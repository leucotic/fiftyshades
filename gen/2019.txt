That leather strap! We've never used a leather strap before. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. His eyes glance over the strap, and everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Ready?,' he murmurs in my ear, sending shivers down my spine. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He caresses my hair, gazing at me tenderly, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. <p> He leans in, and my heart skips a beat. He softly kisses my throat, dominating, his eyes glowing with lust. Exploring, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. I can hear music faintly. How appropriate. He grabs my hair and yanks down, pulling my head back as we kiss, savagely. <p> Catching me off guard, he shoves me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and my breathing is too loud. He traces his fingers down my neck so that desire courses through my blood. How can he turn me on with one word?
