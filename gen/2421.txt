'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he whispers. His voice is husky, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. I glance nervously at the playroom. <p> He lifts my chin, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He kisses me, tasting. He softly kisses my cheek, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I squirm against him, and he curls his fingers around my head, pulling my head back as we kiss, forcefully. My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. <i>Crap</i>. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> All of a sudden, he pushes me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and I groan, frustrated. His hands trace down my body gently so that desire courses through my blood. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Oh, I want this</i>. <p>
