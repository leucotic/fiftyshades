His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. <i>Shit</i>. His eyes glance over the cuffs, and my muscles clench deep inside me. <p> 'Ready?,' he growls. His breathing is husky, and an electric thrill thrums through me. <p> 'Please.' I swallow. <p> He caresses my hair, gazing at me lovingly, my insides liquefying. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, tasting, igniting a fire deep within. Dominating, exploring, his eyes glowing with lust, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. He softly kisses my throat, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. I moan into his mouth, and he curls his fingers around my head, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the desk. My pulse is haywire, making me writhe, making me writhe. He trails his fingers softly across my neck, and I surrender briefly to the sensation. How can he turn me on with one word?
