His rope is coiled on the foot of the bed. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he growls teasingly, igniting a fire deep within. <p> 'Please.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He caresses my cheek, gazing at me lovingly, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, making me tremble. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, tasting, raising uncontrollable urges in me, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. He kisses me, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. Holding me gently in place as we kiss, frantically, his fingers curl into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> Suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the wall. I'm going to combust, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. Exploring, he softly kisses my temple. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing.
