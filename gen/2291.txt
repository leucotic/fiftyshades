Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my bottom lip, dominating, coursing heat throughout my body. He softly kisses my throat, and everything in my body tightens. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and everything in my body tightens. One of his hands moves into my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss. My inner goddess glares at me. <p> 'Turn around.' <p> That rope! We've never used rope before. I glance anxiously at the playroom. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'I want you so much,' he breathes as he hovers over me. Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the wall. My pulse is haywire, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. He skims his fingertips softly across my back so that I'm drowning in a pool of desire. I blush scarlet, humiliated and excited at the same time. <i>Holy crap</i>.
