Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my bottom lip, dominating, warmth pooling below my waist. Tasting, insistent, his mouth is on mine. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. Holding my head in place as we kiss, savagely, his fingers curl into my hair, holding tight. <p> 'Turn around.' <p> His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I glance nervously at the playroom. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'You are so beautiful,' he whispers, pinning me with his bold gaze. Abruptly, he slams me against the bedpost. He's pinning me to the bedpost using his hips, and it's pleasure overload. He runs his hands gently down my neck so that I lose myself to his fervent passion. How can he turn me on with one word?
