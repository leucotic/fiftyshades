He grins against my neck. Boy, he's so complicated. His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Ready?,' he breathes, his eyes intense, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously as I tingle ... everywhere. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He caresses my cheek, gazing at me tenderly, coursing heat throughout my body. <p> He reaches down, and my breath hitches. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, insistent, dominating. His tongue invades my mouth, exploring, shallowing my breath. The pulsing strains of Kings of Leon drift through the headphones he put on me. How unexpected. I gasp and moan , and he curls his fingers around my head, holding my head in place. <p> Abruptly, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the doorway. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He traces his fingers across my neck softly so that I am awash with sensation. How can he do this to me?
