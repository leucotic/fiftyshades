Holy shit. That sex appeal!<p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he whispers, staring intently into my eyes. <p> Tipping my chin back, his tongue invades my mouth, dominating, making me squirm. He softly kisses my cheek, and tingling shoots through me. He kisses me, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I bite my lip, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, pulling my head back as we kiss, frantically. My subconscious is staring at me in awe. <p> Suddenly, he slams me against the desk. He holds me against his hips, and my pulse is haywire. Forceful, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. It's pleasure overload. <p>
