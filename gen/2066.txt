Holy crap. That power!<p> 'God, I need you,' he breathes, staring intently into my eyes. <p> Leaning down, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, dominating, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He softly kisses my throat, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. Exploring, tasting, his mouth is on mine. His hand tightens around my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, savagely. My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> Catching me off guard, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the desk. I groan loudly, panting, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He trails his fingertips up my neck. I inhale sharply. I flush deeply, humiliated and excited at the same time. <i>Holy hell</i>. <p>
