Crap. That sex appeal!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. <p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and my stomach somersaults. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, dominating, insistent. He kisses me, tasting, warmth pooling below my waist. His eyes glowing with lust, dominating, his tongue invades my mouth. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> Abruptly, he pushes me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and my heart is pounding. He kisses me, and desire courses through my blood. It's pleasure overload. <p>
