His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he growls teasingly, shallowing my breath. <p> 'Please,' I breathe . <p> His fingers brush my face gently, my insides liquefying. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, igniting my blood. His mouth is on mine, tasting, sparking electricity ... below. He curls his fingers around my head, holding my head in place as we kiss. My subconscious glares at me. <p> Moving suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the doorway. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me yearn for him, making me yearn for him. He skims his fingers up my neck so that desire seizes me with a vengeance. How can he turn me on with one word?
