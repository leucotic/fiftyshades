'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he growls. His breathing is hard, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> 'Okay.' I swallow. <p> 'Good,' he murmurs, his breathing harsh. <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I whisper. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, shallowing my breath. Tasting, exploring, his mouth is on mine. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, one of his hands moves into my hair, running his fingers through my hair.
