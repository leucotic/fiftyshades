Oh my. That sex appeal!<p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he breathes as he hovers over me. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my throat, dominating, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. His mouth is on mine, exploring, shallowing my breath, raising uncontrollable urges in me. His tongue invades my mouth, dominating, igniting a fire deep within, igniting a fire deep within. His eyes glowing with lust, insistent, tasting, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. The haunting strains of Tallis drift through the headphones he put on me. How appropriate. I bite my lip, and he curls his fingers around my head, holding my head in place. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the wall. All the air leaves my body, making me writhe. Exploring, he kisses me. I inhale sharply. <p>
