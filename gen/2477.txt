'Do you want to play? ,' he murmurs in my ear, shallowing my breath. I glance anxiously at the bed. <p> He reaches down, and my breath hitches. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating. His eyes glowing with lust, tasting, he softly kisses my throat. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. He curls his fingers into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. I glance nervously at the playroom. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> Suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the bedpost. It's so hot, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, frantic, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. I'm going to combust. <p>
