Suddenly, he slams me against the desk. He's pinning me to the desk using his hips, and my breathing is too loud. Exploring, his eyes wild, he kisses me. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. <p> He reaches down, and my heart starts pounding. His mouth is on mine, exploring, insistent. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, sparking electricity ... below. Exploring, he kisses me. He softly kisses my throat, and I tingle ... everywhere. I can hear a song by Kings of Leon drifting through the air. I love his choice. One of his hands moves into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss, frantically.
