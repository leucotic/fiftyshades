'Here? ,' he growls in my ear, sending delicious shivers down my spine. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my face, exploring, igniting a fire deep within. His mouth is on mine, tasting, sparking electricity ... below, making me squirm. His eyes glowing with lust, exploring, dominating, he kisses me. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, he curls his fingers around my head, holding tight. My subconscious has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly. <p> He straightens. If only it didn't take a contract and a pair of handcuffs to satisfy him. His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> Without warning, he slams me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and I inhale sharply. His fingertips run along my back. It's so hot. How can his body do this to me?<p>
