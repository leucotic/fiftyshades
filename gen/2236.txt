'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he growls in my ear, sparking electricity ... below. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and my heart starts pounding. He softly kisses my bottom lip, insistent. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, my insides liquefying. He kisses me, and everything in my body tightens. Exploring, his tongue invades my mouth. Holding me firmly in place, he curls his fingers around my head, holding tight. My inner goddess swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. I glance anxiously at the playroom. His eyes glance over the paddle, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> Without warning, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the bedpost. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. His mouth is on mine, and my body rises and fills with my arousal. It's so hot. <p>
