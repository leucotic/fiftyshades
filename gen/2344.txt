He lifts my chin, and my breathing accelerates. He softly kisses my throat, tasting. His tongue invades my mouth, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I can hear music faintly. How appropriate. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, forcefully, his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, running his fingers through my hair. <p> 'Face the wall.' <p> He stalks gracefully forward. If only it didn't take a contract and a pair of nipple clamps to satisfy him. Those nipple clamps! We've never used a pair of nipple clamps before. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'God, I need you,' he whispers as he hovers over me. Suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the wall. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His fingertips trail up my body so that my body rises and fills with my arousal. I blush deeply, humiliated and turned on at the same time. <i>I want him so badly</i>.
