'Do you want to play? ,' he murmurs teasingly, igniting my blood. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, tasting, making me tremble. Exploring, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. His tongue invades my mouth, insistent, coursing heat throughout my body. He kisses me, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. One of his hands moves into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss. My subconscious glares at me. <p> His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. <i>Oh my</i>. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> Suddenly, he shoves me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and it's so hot. He trails his fingers down my thighs, and my body rises and fills with my arousal. I blush , feeling my face flame. <i>Holy crap</i>. <p>
