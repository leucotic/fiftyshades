I want him so badly. That sex appeal!<p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he breathes, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Leaning down, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, sending shivers down my spine. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, anticipation and anxiety charging through me, coursing heat throughout my body. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and everything in my body tightens. I moan again into his mouth, and his hand tightens around my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, savagely. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the wall. I practically convulse, making me writhe. His mouth is on mine, and I am awash with sensation. My breathing is too loud. <p>
