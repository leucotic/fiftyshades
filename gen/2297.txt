I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> 'Do you want to play? ,' he breathes. His voice is husky, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> 'Okay.' I swallow. <p> He cups my face gently, making me tremble. <p> Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, dominating, igniting my blood. Dominating, his eyes glowing with lust, insistent, his tongue invades my mouth. Dominating, exploring, his mouth is on mine. He curls his fingers into my hair, holding my head in place. My subconscious glares at me. <p> All of a sudden, he shoves me against the bedpost. He's pinning me to the bedpost using his hips, and I inhale sharply. He softly kisses my bottom lip, frantic, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. My heart is pounding.
