He grins against my neck. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. His fingers brush the cuffs, and my muscles clench deep inside me. <p> 'Do you want to play? ,' he whispers. His voice is hard, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> 'Okay.' My voice is barely audible. <p> His fingers brush my face gently, making me squirm. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, sparking electricity ... below. Tasting, exploring, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. He kisses me, exploring, making my muscles clench in response. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. His fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss. My subconscious does the samba. <p> Abruptly, he pushes me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and it's pleasure overload. He traces his fingers across my thighs softly so that I am all sensation. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>I want him so badly</i>.
