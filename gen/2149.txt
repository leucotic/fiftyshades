'You were very disobedient,' he breathes in my ear, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> He lifts my chin, and I'm quaking like a leaf. His tongue invades my mouth, exploring, exploring. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, warmth pooling below my waist. His mouth is on mine, and I tingle ... everywhere. He curls his fingers around my head, pulling my head back as we kiss. My subconscious glares at me. <p> That leather strap! We've never used a leather strap before. <i>Holy shit</i>. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> Suddenly, he pushes me against the bedpost. He's pinning me to the bedpost using his hips, and it's so hot. He kisses me, frantic, making me yearn for him, making me yearn for him. It's pleasure overload. <p>
