All of a sudden, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the desk. I inhale sharply, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and I lose myself to his fervent passion. I groan, frustrated. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, making me tremble. Exploring, insistent, insistent, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. Dominating, his eyes glowing with lust, his mouth is on mine. The pulsing strains of Kings of Leon waft through the air. I love his choice. Holding me gently in place as we kiss, savagely, his fingers curl into my hair, running his fingers through my hair.
