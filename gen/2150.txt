He softly kisses my face, exploring, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. All the air leaves my body. <p> Leaning down, he kisses me, tasting, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. His eyes glowing with lust, his eyes glowing with lust, insistent, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. I can hear music faintly. How unexpected. Pulling my head back, he curls his fingers around my head, holding tight.
