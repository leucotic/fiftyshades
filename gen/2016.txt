His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. My breath hitches. Boy, he's so hard to please. <p> 'Do you want me? ,' he murmurs. His eyes are slate, burning, and everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Okay.' I swallow. <p> He caresses my hair, gazing at me tenderly, sending shivers down my spine. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, shallowing my breath. Tasting, he softly kisses my throat. His eyes glowing with lust, insistent, his eyes glowing with lust, his mouth is on mine. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place. My subconscious is screaming at me. <p> Catching me off guard, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the wall. My breathing is too loud, making me writhe. His fingers softly skim across my body. I practically convulse. I flush deeply, humiliated and turned on at the same time. <i>Holy shit</i>.
