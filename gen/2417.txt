His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. <i>Holy cow</i>. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Do you want to play? ,' he whispers in my ear, my insides liquefying. <p> 'Okay,' I whisper . <p> He smiles twistedly. 'Remember, I'll never hurt you.' He cups my face gently, igniting my blood. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, dominating, making my muscles clench in response. He softly kisses my face, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I yelp, and his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, pulling my head back as we kiss. <p> Suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the bedpost. My breathing is too loud, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. His hands trail across my belly softly, and desire courses through my blood. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>I want him so badly</i>.
