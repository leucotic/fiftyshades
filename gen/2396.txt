'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he breathes. His gaze is burning, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'Tell me what you want,' he whispers, his breathing harsh. <p> 'Surprise me,' I breathe. <p> He lifts my chin, and my breathing accelerates. He kisses me, insistent. His mouth is on mine, exploring, warmth pooling below my waist. Holding my head in place as we kiss, he curls his fingers around my head, fisting his hands. My inner goddess is screaming at me.
