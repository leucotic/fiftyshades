Suddenly, he slams me against the desk. He holds me against his hips, and fuck, I'm panting already. Exploring, lustful, he kisses me. It's pleasure overload. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, warmth pooling below my waist. His mouth is on mine, and an electric thrill thrums through me. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, my insides liquefying, making me squirm. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place. My subconscious has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly.
