Suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the desk. My pulse is haywire, making me writhe. His fingertips trace up my thighs. I practically convulse. I blush , feeling my face flame, ashamed and excited at the same time. <i>Shit</i>. <p> He leans in, and my heart starts pounding. His tongue invades my mouth, tasting, insistent, exploring. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, tasting, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. Dominating, his eyes glowing with lust, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. I moan, and he curls his fingers into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss, forcefully. My inner goddess does the samba.
