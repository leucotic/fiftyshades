He grins against my neck. Jeez, he's so fucked-up. His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'You were very disobedient,' he breathes in my ear, igniting a fire deep within. <p> 'Okay...' I whisper . <p> He cups my face gently, raising uncontrollable urges in me. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, tasting, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, sending shivers down my spine. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. My subconscious glares at me. <p> Catching me off guard, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the bedpost. I inhale sharply, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He trails his fingertips up my back. It's pleasure overload. How can he do this to me?
