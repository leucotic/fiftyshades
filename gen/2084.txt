Oh my. That power!<p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he breathes, staring intently into my eyes. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, shallowing my breath. Exploring, tasting, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. His mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, anticipation and anxiety charging through me, making me tremble. I yelp, and he curls his fingers into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss. My inner goddess has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the doorway. It's pleasure overload, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. Exploring, his tongue invades my mouth. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. <p>
