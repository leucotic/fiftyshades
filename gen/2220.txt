He straightens. Jeez, he's so hard to please. That rope! We've never used rope before. His fingers brush the coil, and I tingle ... everywhere. <p> 'You were very disobedient,' he growls, his eyes gray, and an electric thrill thrums through me as everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes...' I exhale . <p> He touches my face gently, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, dominating, raising uncontrollable urges in me. His tongue invades my mouth, exploring, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He softly kisses my throat, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. Insistent, dominating, his eyes glowing with lust, his mouth is on mine. Pulling my head back, his hand tightens around my hair, fisting his hands. My inner goddess is purring with pleasure. <p> Suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the desk. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me yearn for him. He kisses me, exploring, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. All the air leaves my body.
