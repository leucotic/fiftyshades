'Do you want to play? ,' he growls in my ear, making me squirm. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'Tell me what you want,' he breathes, his voice hard. <p> 'Take me,' I exhale. <p> He reaches down, and my breath hitches. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, tasting. He kisses me, and an electric thrill thrums through me. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, sparking electricity ... below, sending delicious shivers down my spine. His eyes glowing with lust, exploring, he softly kisses my bottom lip. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, his hand tightens around my hair, holding tight. My subconscious is staring at me in awe.
