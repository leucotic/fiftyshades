His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I glance nervously at the doorway. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> 'Do you want me? ,' he murmurs in my ear, coursing heat throughout my body. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' I swallow. <p> He cups my face gently, making me tremble. <p> Tipping my chin back, his tongue invades my mouth, tasting, igniting a fire deep within. His mouth is on mine, exploring, raising uncontrollable urges in me, shallowing my breath. Holding me firmly in place, his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, fisting his hands. My subconscious is purring with pleasure. <p> Abruptly, he shoves me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and it's pleasure overload. He softly kisses my temple, and I'm drowning in a pool of desire. My heart is pounding.
