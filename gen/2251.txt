Holy cow. That gaze!<p> 'I want you so much,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, making my muscles clench in response. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, tasting, igniting a fire deep within, making me squirm. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and an electric thrill thrums through me. I bite my lip, and one of his hands moves into my hair, pulling my head back. My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> All of a sudden, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the desk. I'm going to combust, making me yearn for him. His fingers skim along my thighs softly, and I lose myself to his fervent passion. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Holy shit</i>. <p>
