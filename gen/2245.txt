His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. <i>Oh, I want this</i>. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'You were very disobedient,' he murmurs, his voice hard, and an electric thrill thrums through me as a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes...' I whisper . <p> His fingers brush my face gently, igniting my blood. <p> He lifts my chin, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent. Insistent, dominating, his mouth is on mine. He kisses me, exploring, raising uncontrollable urges in me. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. The sultry strains of Tallis waft through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. Pulling my head back as we kiss, savagely, he grabs my hair and yanks down, fisting his hands. <p> Without warning, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the desk. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, making me writhe. He trails his fingers down my thighs. My breathing is too loud. How can he turn me on with one word?
