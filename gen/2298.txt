'I want to hear you scream for me.' <p> 'Take me,' I exhale. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. Insistent, his tongue invades my mouth. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, sparking electricity ... below. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place. My inner goddess has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly.
