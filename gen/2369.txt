He grins against my neck. If only it didn't take a contract and a pair of nipple clamps to satisfy him. Those nipple clamps! We've never used a pair of nipple clamps before. His eyes glance over the clamps, and everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Do you want to play? ,' he whispers. His eyes are smouldering, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes...' I breathe . <p> He cups my face gently, shallowing my breath. <p> He leans in, and my heart skips a beat. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, dominating, insistent. He softly kisses my cheek, his eyes glowing with lust, making my muscles clench in response, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. His mouth is on mine, tasting, raising uncontrollable urges in me, sparking electricity ... below. His tongue invades my mouth, exploring, igniting my blood. His hand tightens around my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss, forcefully. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance. <p> Catching me off guard, he shoves me against the desk. He's pinning me to the desk using his hips, and I groan loudly, panting. His hands run down my belly gently. All the air leaves my body. I blush scarlet. <i>I want him so badly</i>.
