Shit. That look!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he breathes, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, making me squirm. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, making my muscles clench in response, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, his fingers curl into my hair, fisting his hands. <p> Abruptly, he slams me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and it's so eroticâ€”his need for me. Forceful, his mouth is on mine. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. <p>
