'Do you want me? ,' he whispers, his voice harsh, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me as I tingle ... everywhere. I glance anxiously at the playroom. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my face, insistent, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. Exploring, dominating, he softly kisses my bottom lip. His mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, sending shivers down my spine, making me squirm. I moan again , and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place as we kiss, forcefully. My inner goddess does a slow erotic dance. <p> His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. My heart starts pounding. If only it didn't take a contract and a paddle to please him. <p> Abruptly, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the doorway. I'm going to combust, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He softly kisses my cheek, and my craving spirals out of control. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me. <p>
