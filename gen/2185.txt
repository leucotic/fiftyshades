Without warning, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the wall. I'm going to combust, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. His mouth is on mine, frantic, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. It's so hot. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, making me squirm. His eyes glowing with lust, exploring, dominating, he softly kisses my face. Pulling my head back, he curls his fingers around my head, holding tight. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance.
