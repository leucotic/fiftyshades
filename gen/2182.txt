'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he growls, his gaze stormy, and my muscles clench deep inside me as dark desire unfolds throughout my body. I shiver anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my cheek, his eyes glowing with lust, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. Tasting, insistent, he softly kisses my bottom lip. His mouth is on mine, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. He kisses me, tasting, igniting my blood. The sultry strains of Justin Bieber waft through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I gasp at his words , and he grabs my hair and yanks down, pulling my head back. <p> His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. <i>Holy hell</i>. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> Moving suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the wall. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. His tongue invades my mouth, forceful, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. I practically convulse. <p>
