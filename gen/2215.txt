Suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the wall. I'm going to combust, making me writhe. He traces his fingertips down my thighs so that desire and anxiety pump through me. I blush from my head to my toes, humiliated and excited at the same time. <i>Holy shit</i>. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, insistent, making me squirm. He softly kisses my bottom lip, tasting, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>, coursing heat throughout my body. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. Holding me gently in place, he grabs my hair and yanks down, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves.
