Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. <i>Crap</i>. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'Do you want to play? ,' he whispers in my ear, shallowing my breath. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes,' I exhale . <p> He smiles teasingly. 'Remember, I'll never hurt you.' He cups my face gently, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. <p> He reaches down, and my breath hitches. His tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, dominating. He kisses me, and everything in my body tightens. He softly kisses my cheek, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, his hand tightens around my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My inner goddess is screaming at me. <p> All of a sudden, he pushes me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and it's so hot. His mouth is on mine, frantic, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing.
