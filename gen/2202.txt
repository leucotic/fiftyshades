Holy shit. That gaze!<p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he breathes, staring intently into my eyes. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, insistent, coursing heat throughout my body. His tongue invades my mouth, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. He kisses me, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. He softly kisses my cheek, and I tingle ... everywhere. He grabs my hair and yanks down, pulling my head back. My subconscious is purring with pleasure. <p> Abruptly, he pushes me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and I groan, frustrated. His fingertips gently trail up my body. I'm going to combust. I flush deeply. <i>Holy hell</i>. <p>
