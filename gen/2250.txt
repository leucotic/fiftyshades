Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, making me tremble. He softly kisses my temple, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. Insistent, his mouth is on mine. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, warmth pooling below my waist. I can hear music faintly. How unexpected. I squirm against him, and his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, pulling my head back as we kiss. <p> 'On your knees,' he growls, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside and feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. <p> He grins against my neck. God, he's so fucked-up. That flogger! We've never used a flogger before. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'You. Are. So. Beautiful,' he breathes as he hovers over me. Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the bedpost. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, making me writhe. His hands gently run down my neck. I groan, frustrated. How can he turn me on with one word?
