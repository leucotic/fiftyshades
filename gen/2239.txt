Catching me off guard, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the doorway. My breathing is too loud, making me yearn for him. His fingers trace up my back softly. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me. How can he do this to me?<p> Leaning down, he kisses me, exploring, making me tremble. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, igniting my blood, making my muscles clench in response. Dominating, insistent, his tongue invades my mouth. Pulling my head back as we kiss, his fingers curl into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious is screaming at me.
