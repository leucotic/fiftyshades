'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he whispers. His gaze is gray, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I glance nervously at the bed. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, exploring, igniting a fire deep within. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. He softly kisses my throat, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting my blood, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. I can hear a song by Miley Cyrus drifting through the air. How unexpected. Holding me gently in place as we kiss, one of his hands moves into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. <p> That flogger! We've never used a flogger before. I shiver anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> Abruptly, he pushes me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and I inhale sharply. He runs his fingers up my back so that desire courses through my blood. I flush from my head to my toes. <i>Crap</i>. <p>
