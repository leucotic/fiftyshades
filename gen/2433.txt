His rope is coiled on the foot of the bed. My heart starts pounding in anticipation. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> 'Do you want to play? ,' he growls, his voice hard, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body as everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Okay...' I exhale . <p> His lips tense. 'Good girl.' He caresses my hair, gazing at me lovingly, sending shivers down my spine. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my breath hitches. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, tasting, his eyes glowing with lust. His mouth is on mine, exploring, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. His fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss. My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> Catching me off guard, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the wall. I'm going to combust, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. He runs his hands gently along my belly so that my body rises and fills with my arousal. How does he have this power over me?
