Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, making me squirm. He kisses me, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. He softly kisses my throat, insistent, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. His tongue invades my mouth, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. His fingers curl into my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss, savagely. My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> 'Turn around,' he growls, shallowing my breath and igniting my blood. <p> His rope is coiled on the foot of the bed. <i>Holy hell</i>. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'You are so beautiful,' he murmurs, staring intently into my eyes. Without warning, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the wall. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He skims his fingertips softly up my thighs so that I am all sensation. How does he have this power over me?
