I can hear a song by Kings of Leon drifting through the air. How appropriate. One of his hands moves into my hair, holding me gently in place as we kiss. <p> 'Face the wall,' he breathes, anticipation and anxiety charging through me and my insides liquefying. <p> That rope! We've never used rope before. I'm quaking like a leaf. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he murmurs, pinning me with his bold gaze. Without warning, he pushes me against the desk. He restrains me with his hips, and I inhale sharply. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, frantic, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. My heart is pounding.
