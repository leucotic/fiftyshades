Moving suddenly, he pushes me against the desk. He's pinning me to the desk using his hips, and my breathing is too loud. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, his eyes wild, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. <p> He lifts my chin, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He softly kisses my cheek, insistent, dominating, insistent. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and my muscles clench deep inside me. His eyes glowing with lust, exploring, he kisses me. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place.
