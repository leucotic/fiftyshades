'You were very disobedient,' he growls, his breathing hard, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me as desire unfurls deep in my belly. I glance nervously at the doorway. <p> He lifts my chin, and my breath hitches. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, insistent, tasting. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. The sensual strains of Miley Cyrus waft through the air. How appropriate. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, pulling my head back as we kiss, savagely. <p> His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. <i>Holy cow</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> Catching me off guard, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the desk. I practically convulse, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and I lose myself to his fervent passion. I inhale sharply. <p>
