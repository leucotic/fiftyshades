'Ready?,' he growls. His breathing is harsh, and my muscles clench deep inside me. <p> 'Yes.' I swallow. <p> He smiles wickedly. 'Good girl.' <p> 'Surprise me,' I whisper. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my breathing accelerates. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, dominating, exploring. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, making me tremble, shallowing my breath. Tasting, dominating, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I yelp, and his hand tightens around my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss.
