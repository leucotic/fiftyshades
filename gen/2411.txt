His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I glance nervously at the bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Ready?,' he growls, his voice harsh, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body as everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. <p> 'Okay...' I whisper . <p> His lips part. 'Good.' He touches my face gently, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my temple, insistent, making me tremble. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and an electric thrill thrums through me. His mouth is on mine, exploring, making me tremble, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place as we kiss, savagely. <p> Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the wall. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He kisses me, exploring, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. My heart is pounding.
