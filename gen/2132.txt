Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> 'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he breathes teasingly, igniting a fire deep within. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'Tell me what you want,' he whispers, his eyes burning. He caresses my cheek, gazing at me lovingly, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He kisses me, and my muscles clench deep inside me. I squirm against him, and one of his hands moves into my hair, holding my head in place. My inner goddess glares at me. <p> Moving suddenly, he shoves me against the desk. He's pinning me to the desk using his hips, and my heart is pounding. His hands gently run along my neck. All the air leaves my body. How can his body do this to me?
