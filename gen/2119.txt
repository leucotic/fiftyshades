His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. <i>Oh, I want this</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'You were very disobedient,' he growls teasingly, raising uncontrollable urges in me. <p> 'Please...' I whisper . <p> He caresses my cheek, gazing at me lovingly, making my muscles clench in response. <p> Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, insistent, making me tremble. He softly kisses my cheek, dominating, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, making me squirm. Exploring, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. His mouth is on mine, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I yelp, and he curls his fingers into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious is staring at me in awe. <p> Without warning, he shoves me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and I'm going to combust. He kisses me, lustful, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. Fuck, I'm panting already.
