Oh, I want this. That look!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, making me tremble. His mouth is on mine, tasting, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, igniting a fire deep within. He softly kisses my throat, and everything in my body tightens. I can hear music faintly. How appropriate. Holding my head in place as we kiss, frantically, his fingers curl into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. <p> Without warning, he slams me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and I practically convulse. He softly traces his hands up my thighs. My heart is pounding. How can his body do this to me?<p>
