Crap. That sex appeal!<p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he whispers, staring intently into my eyes. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my throat, dominating, sending shivers down my spine. His tongue invades my mouth, insistent, igniting a fire deep within, making me squirm. Insistent, tasting, he kisses me. He curls his fingers around my head, pulling my head back. My inner goddess has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly. <p> All of a sudden, he shoves me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and all the air leaves my body. He softly kisses my cheek, frantic, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. I inhale sharply. <p>
