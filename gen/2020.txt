His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I tremble anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. If only it didn't take a contract and a pair of handcuffs to please him. <p> 'Here? ,' he breathes in my ear, making me tremble. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'Good girl,' he murmurs, his voice husky. He cups my face gently, warmth pooling below my waist. <p> Leaning down, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, dominating, shallowing my breath. His mouth is on mine, exploring, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside, igniting a fire deep within. Dominating, his eyes glowing with lust, his tongue invades my mouth. One of his hands moves into my hair, holding me firmly in place. My subconscious is staring at me in awe. <p> Abruptly, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the desk. I inhale sharply, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. Frantic, forceful, he softly kisses my bottom lip. I practically convulse.
