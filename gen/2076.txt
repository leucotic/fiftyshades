Crap. That sex appeal!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my temple, tasting, coursing heat throughout my body. His mouth is on mine, insistent, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I moan, and his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. My subconscious is screaming at me. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the wall. I practically convulse, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His tongue invades my mouth, forceful, making me yearn for him. All the air leaves my body. <p>
