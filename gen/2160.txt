Without warning, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the desk. It's so hot, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. He skims his fingers across my neck so that desire and anxiety pump through me. I flush deeply, humiliated and turned on at the same time. <i>Oh my</i>. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my face, tasting, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. He kisses me, exploring, igniting my blood, making my muscles clench in response. He grabs my hair and yanks down, pulling my head back as we kiss. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance.
