Shit. That power!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he growls as he hovers over me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my cheek, insistent, shallowing my breath. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His hand tightens around my hair, holding me gently in place. <p> Catching me off guard, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the desk. My heart is pounding, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His fingers trace up my body so that I surrender briefly to the sensation. How can he turn me on with one word?<p>
