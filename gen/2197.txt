He smiles a slow sexy smile. God, he's so hard to please. His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'Here? ,' he murmurs. His breathing is hard, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. <p> 'Please.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He caresses my hair, gazing at me lovingly, igniting a fire deep within. <p> He leans in, and my heart skips a beat. He kisses me, dominating. He softly kisses my cheek, and my muscles clench deep inside me. He kisses me, dominating, making me tremble, igniting my blood. I squirm against him, and he curls his fingers into my hair, pulling my head back. My inner goddess is screaming at me. <p> Moving suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the desk. My breathing is too loud, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He gently trails his hands up my body so that I surrender briefly to the sensation. How does he have this power over me?
