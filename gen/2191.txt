Crap. That look!<p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he growls, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He softly kisses my temple, dominating, making me tremble, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, anticipation and anxiety charging through me, igniting my blood. I squirm against him, and one of his hands moves into my hair, holding my head in place. My inner goddess is screaming at me. <p> Without warning, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the bedpost. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. He kisses me, forceful, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. I groan, frustrated. <p>
