Moving suddenly, he pushes me against the desk. He restrains me with his hips, and fuck, I'm panting already. He trails his fingers gently down my thighs. My heart is pounding. How can he do this to me?<p> Leaning down, he kisses me, exploring, shallowing my breath. Exploring, tasting, dominating, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and my muscles clench deep inside me. I squirm against him, and his fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss. My subconscious does the samba.
