All of a sudden, he shoves me against the wall. He restrains me with his hips, and it's so eroticâ€”his need for me. His hands run down my body so that desire seizes me with a vengeance. How can his body do this to me?<p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, insistent, coursing heat throughout my body. Exploring, he softly kisses my bottom lip. He softly kisses my cheek, tasting, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. He kisses me, and an electric thrill thrums through me. One of his hands moves into my hair, holding me gently in place. My subconscious is staring at me in awe.
