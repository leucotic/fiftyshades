He reaches down, and my heart skips a beat. He softly kisses my cheek, dominating. His tongue invades my mouth, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. His mouth is on mine, and my muscles clench deep inside me. His fingers curl into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly. <p> 'Turn around.' <p> He straightens. My mouth goes dry. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. That flogger! We've never used a flogger before. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'God, I need you,' he whispers, staring intently into my eyes. Without warning, he pushes me against the desk. He's pinning me to the desk using his hips, and all the air leaves my body. His fingers trail along my body gently so that I am all sensation. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Shit</i>.
