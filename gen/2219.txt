I want him so badly. That sex appeal!<p> 'You. Are. So. Beautiful,' he whispers as he hovers over me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my bottom lip, tasting, my insides liquefying. Insistent, dominating, tasting, his mouth is on mine. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, warmth pooling below my waist. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss, frantically. <p> Without warning, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the desk. I'm going to combust, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. He softly kisses my cheek, and I am awash with sensation. I groan, frustrated. <p>
