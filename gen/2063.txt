'Ready?,' he growls, his gaze burning, and everything in my body tightens as desire unfurls deep in my belly. I glance anxiously at the doorway. <p> Leaning down, his tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, making me tremble. He kisses me, exploring, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside, my insides liquefying. His mouth is on mine, and tingling shoots through me. The pulsing strains of Miley Cyrus drift through the headphones he put on me. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I squirm against him, and his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, pulling my head back. <p> Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. I glance nervously at the bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Moving suddenly, he pushes me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and my breathing is too loud. His hands trail up my back gently. I groan loudly, panting. I blush scarlet. <i>Crap</i>. <p>
