'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he breathes teasingly, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. My heart starts pounding. <p> He lifts my chin, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting. Dominating, insistent, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. Dominating, his tongue invades my mouth. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. His fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss. <p> He smiles a slow sexy smile. If only it didn't take a contract and a paddle to satisfy him. His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. His eyes glance over the paddle, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. <p> Without warning, he slams me against the bedpost. He holds me against his hips, and it's so eroticâ€”his need for me. His fingertips trace up my belly. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. I blush deeply. <i>Holy hell</i>. <p>
