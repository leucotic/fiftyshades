His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I glance anxiously at the playroom. God, he's so fucked-up. <p> 'Do you want me? ,' he growls, his voice low, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me as desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> 'Please.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'Remember, I'll never hurt you. This will be hard, but I won't hurt you.' He caresses my hair, gazing at me tenderly, raising uncontrollable urges in me. <p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and my heart skips a beat. He kisses me, exploring. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting a fire deep within. The sensual strains of Miley Cyrus drift through the headphones he put on me. I love his choice. He curls his fingers around my head, pulling my head back. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the doorway. My heart is pounding, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His fingertips skim across my neck so that I am all sensation. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Shit</i>.
