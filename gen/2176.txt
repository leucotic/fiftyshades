He stalks gracefully forward. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Do you want me? ,' he breathes, his voice husky, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body as tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Yes.' I swallow. <p> His lips twitch. 'This is not going to hurt. It will be intense.' He caresses my cheek, gazing at me lovingly, coursing heat throughout my body. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my stomach somersaults. He kisses me, exploring, exploring. His tongue invades my mouth, and an electric thrill thrums through me. I yelp, and one of his hands moves into my hair, holding my head in place. My inner goddess does a slow erotic dance. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the doorway. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me writhe. Forceful, frantic, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. I groan, frustrated.
