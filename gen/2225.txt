Tipping my chin back, his tongue invades my mouth, exploring, igniting a fire deep within. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and I tingle ... everywhere. Tasting, his eyes glowing with lust, he softly kisses my cheek. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and my muscles clench deep inside me. His fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance. <p> 'Turn around,' he growls, igniting my blood and warmth pooling below my waist. <p> His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he whispers, pinning me with his bold gaze. Without warning, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the desk. My heart is pounding, making me yearn for him. Frantic, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. Fuck, I'm panting already.
