Holy crap. That look!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he murmurs, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, making my muscles clench in response. His tongue invades my mouth, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. He kisses me, dominating, sparking electricity ... below, coursing heat throughout my body. I can hear a song by Justin Bieber drifting through the air. How unexpected. He grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. <p> Moving suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the doorway. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He softly trails his fingers across my neck, and my body rises and fills with my arousal. How can his body do this to me?<p>
