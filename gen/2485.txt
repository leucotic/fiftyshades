'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he breathes, his breathing hard, and my muscles clench deep inside me as dark desire unfolds throughout my body. <p> 'Okay...' I breathe . <p> 'Tell me what you want. I want to hear you .' <p> 'Take me,' I exhale. <p> Leaning down, his tongue invades my mouth, insistent, igniting a fire deep within. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, making me squirm. His mouth is on mine, dominating, my insides liquefying, warmth pooling below my waist. Exploring, insistent, he kisses me. He curls his fingers around my head, holding me firmly in place as we kiss. My subconscious has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly.
