Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, my insides liquefying. His tongue invades my mouth, dominating, making me squirm, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. Holding me firmly in place, he grabs my hair and yanks down, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious is purring with pleasure. <p> 'Get on the bed,' he growls, igniting my blood and warmth pooling below my waist. <p> That paddle! We've never used a paddle before. I'm quaking like a leaf. I'm suddenly flooded with despair. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> 'Keep still,' he breathes, pinning me with his bold gaze. All of a sudden, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the wall. I groan, frustrated, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. Lustful, forceful, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. I groan loudly, panting.
