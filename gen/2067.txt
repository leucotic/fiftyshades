'Do you want to play? ,' he growls in my ear, making me tremble. I glance nervously at the bed. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. His mouth is on mine, and my muscles clench deep inside me. Exploring, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. One of his hands moves into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, savagely. My subconscious is purring with pleasure. <p> His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. <i>Oh my</i>. His eyes glance over the paddle, and tingling shoots through me. <p> Abruptly, he shoves me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and all the air leaves my body. He skims his hands along my thighs so that my body rises and fills with my arousal. How does he have this power over me?<p>
