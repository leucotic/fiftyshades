He leans in, and my breath hitches. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, exploring. His mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. Insistent, exploring, tasting, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. His mouth is on mine, dominating, shallowing my breath, making me tremble. I gasp at his words , and his fingers curl into my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss, forcefully. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> 'Face the wall.' <p> His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. <i>Holy shit</i>. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'You. Are. So. Beautiful,' he growls as he hovers over me. Without warning, he slams me against the bedpost. He holds me against his hips, and I practically convulse. His fingers gently trail down my belly. My breathing is too loud. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Oh, I want this</i>.
