Crap. That look!<p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he growls, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> He leans in, and I'm quaking like a leaf. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>, raising uncontrollable urges in me. His mouth is on mine, and tingling shoots through me. He softly kisses my throat, dominating, warmth pooling below my waist, making me tremble. He grabs my hair and yanks down, pulling my head back as we kiss, savagely. My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the desk. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. Forceful, frantic, his tongue invades my mouth. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. <p>
