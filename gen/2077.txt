Catching me off guard, he shoves me against the wall. He restrains me with his hips, and it's so eroticâ€”his need for me. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and desire and anxiety pump through me. I inhale sharply. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my temple, tasting, shallowing my breath. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. Dominating, he kisses me. The sultry strains of Kings of Leon waft through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss.
