He grins against my neck. Boy, he's so fucked-up. That rope! We've never used rope before. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'Ready?,' he growls. His breathing is husky, and tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Okay.' I swallow. <p> He caresses my hair, gazing at me tenderly, coursing heat throughout my body. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, igniting a fire deep within. Exploring, dominating, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. I yelp, and his fingers curl into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the desk. I groan loudly, panting, making me yearn for him. His hands trail down my neck. Fuck, I'm panting already. How can he do this to me?
