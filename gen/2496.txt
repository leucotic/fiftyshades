He runs his nose along my jaw, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. He kisses me, dominating, insistent, dominating. Exploring, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. Insistent, tasting, insistent, his tongue invades my mouth. He softly kisses my bottom lip, and an electric thrill thrums through me. He curls his fingers into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance. <p> 'Face the wall.' <p> That paddle! We've never used a paddle before. My breathing accelerates. His fingers brush the paddle, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> 'Keep still,' he breathes, pinning me with his bold gaze. Abruptly, he slams me against the desk. He's pinning me to the desk using his hips, and my breathing is too loud. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, making me yearn for him. All the air leaves my body.
