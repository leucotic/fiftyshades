Abruptly, he shoves me against the wall. He restrains me with his hips, and I inhale sharply. His hands skim up my back so that I lose myself to his fervent passion. How does he have this power over me?<p> He reaches down, and my stomach somersaults. He kisses me, tasting. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and an electric thrill thrums through me. He softly kisses my temple, exploring, anticipation and anxiety charging through me, shallowing my breath. I can hear a song by Miley Cyrus drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I squirm against him, and his hand tightens around my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss, frantically.
