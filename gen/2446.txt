'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he breathes. His voice is hard, and tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' I swallow. <p> His lips tense. 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you.' <p> 'Take me,' I exhale. <p> Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, exploring, sending delicious shivers down my spine. Tasting, his mouth is on mine. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, warmth pooling below my waist, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. He kisses me, and I tingle ... everywhere. I can hear a song by Justin Bieber drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. He grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face.
