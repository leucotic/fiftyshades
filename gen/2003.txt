He smirks at me. Boy, he's so fucked-up. His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. His eyes glance over the instrument, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> 'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he whispers. His breathing is hard, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He smiles teasingly. 'Good.' He touches my face gently, coursing heat throughout my body. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, shallowing my breath. He softly kisses my face, his eyes glowing with lust, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, igniting a fire deep within. He softly kisses my cheek, his eyes glowing with lust, making me squirm, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. His mouth is on mine, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. I squirm against him, and one of his hands moves into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss. My subconscious glares at me. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the doorway. It's pleasure overload, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, making me writhe, making me writhe. I groan loudly, panting.
