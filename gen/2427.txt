Leaning down, he softly kisses my face, exploring, my insides liquefying. Exploring, he kisses me. I gasp at his words , and he curls his fingers around my head, holding me firmly in place. My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> 'Face the wall,' he whispers, and I comply immediately. <p> His rope is coiled on the foot of the bed. I glance anxiously at the doorway. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'I want you so much,' he growls, staring intently into my eyes. Suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the doorway. I'm going to combust, making me writhe. He traces his hands gently across my body so that desire courses through my blood. I flush scarlet, humiliated and turned on at the same time. <i>Holy shit</i>.
