'You were very disobedient,' he murmurs. His voice is husky, and everything in my body tightens. My stomach somersaults. <p> He leans in, and I'm quaking like a leaf. His mouth is on mine, dominating, tasting, exploring. He kisses me, dominating, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. His mouth is on mine, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. His eyes glowing with lust, he softly kisses my face. I can hear a song by Kings of Leon drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. He grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, forcefully. <p> He straightens. God, he's so fucked-up. His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the bedpost. It's pleasure overload, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, frantic, making me writhe. My heart is pounding. <p>
