Moving suddenly, he pushes me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and my pulse is haywire. He gently runs his fingers up my body so that my craving spirals out of control. I blush from my head to my toes, humiliated and excited at the same time. <i>Holy shit</i>. <p> Leaning down, he kisses me, tasting, sending delicious shivers down my spine. His eyes glowing with lust, exploring, his tongue invades my mouth. His mouth is on mine, and tingling shoots through me. He softly kisses my throat, dominating, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. I yelp, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place. My subconscious is staring at me in awe.
