'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he whispers. His voice is husky, and my muscles clench deep inside me. I glance nervously at the doorway. <p> He lifts my chin, and my heart starts pounding. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, dominating, tasting. He kisses me, tasting, my insides liquefying, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. Exploring, tasting, insistent, his mouth is on mine. One of his hands moves into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss. My subconscious has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly. <p> He straightens. God, he's so fucked-up. Those nipple clamps! We've never used a pair of nipple clamps before. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> Moving suddenly, he shoves me against the bedpost. He's pinning me to the bedpost using his hips, and it's so hot. His fingertips softly run up my neck so that I am awash with sensation. How can he turn me on with one word?<p>
