That paddle! We've never used a paddle before. I glance anxiously at the doorway. I'm suddenly flooded with despair. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> 'Do you want me? ,' he breathes, his breathing husky, and everything in my body tightens as a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes...' I breathe . <p> 'Good girl,' he murmurs, his gaze darkening. He caresses my hair, gazing at me tenderly, making me squirm. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my throat, dominating, warmth pooling below my waist. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, sparking electricity ... below. He curls his fingers around my head, holding me gently in place. My subconscious is thrilled. <p> Without warning, he shoves me against the desk. He's pinning me to the desk using his hips, and my pulse is haywire. His mouth is on mine, forceful, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing.
