'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he growls, his breathing hard, and my muscles clench deep inside me as a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> He lifts my chin, and my heart skips a beat. He kisses me, dominating. His mouth is on mine, tasting, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, shallowing my breath. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I squirm against him, and his hand tightens around my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss. <p> He smiles a slow sexy smile. Jeez, he's so complicated. His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. His fingers brush the strap, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the desk. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. Exploring, lustful, he softly kisses my throat. It's so hot. <p>
