He lifts my chin, and my breathing accelerates. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, tasting. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and tingling shoots through me. He curls his fingers into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss, savagely. My subconscious does the samba. <p> 'Get on the bed.' <p> Those nipple clamps! We've never used a pair of nipple clamps before. <i>Holy hell</i>. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'I want you so much,' he whispers, pinning me with his bold gaze. Without warning, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the wall. It's pleasure overload, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His mouth is on mine, exploring, making me writhe, making me writhe. I practically convulse.
