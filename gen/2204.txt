'Do you want to play? ,' he whispers. His eyes are burning brighter, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I shiver anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, tasting, making me tremble. He kisses me, and my muscles clench deep inside me. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, warmth pooling below my waist, warmth pooling below my waist. I can hear music faintly. How appropriate. I moan against his lips, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. <p> That rope! We've never used rope before. <i>Oh, I want this</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the doorway. My pulse is haywire, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His fingers softly trace across my thighs. Fuck, I'm panting already. How can he turn me on with one word?<p>
