He lifts my chin, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. His mouth is on mine, tasting. He softly kisses my bottom lip, and tingling shoots through me. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, igniting my blood, shallowing my breath. His tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, warmth pooling below my waist, sending delicious shivers down my spine. The sensual strains of Miley Cyrus drift through the headphones he put on me. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding my head in place. <p> 'Turn around.' <p> His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. I'm quaking like a leaf. I'm suddenly flooded with despair. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> 'You are so beautiful,' he whispers as he hovers over me. All of a sudden, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the desk. My breathing is too loud, making me yearn for him. He skims his hands across my body gently, and I surrender briefly to the sensation. I blush scarlet. <i>Holy crap</i>.
