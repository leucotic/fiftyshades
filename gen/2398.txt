'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he whispers, his breathing husky, and a delicious tingling shoots through me as a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I glance anxiously at the doorway. <p> Leaning down, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, igniting my blood. He kisses me, and I tingle ... everywhere. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, making me squirm. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, pulling my head back. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance. <p> That paddle! We've never used a paddle before. My breathing accelerates. I'm suddenly flooded with despair. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> Without warning, he pushes me against the wall. He restrains me with his hips, and I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. He trails his hands along my neck, and desire and anxiety pump through me. How can his body do this to me?<p>
