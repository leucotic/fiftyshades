Oh my. That sex appeal!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he whispers as he hovers over me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, making my muscles clench in response. Insistent, his eyes glowing with lust, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. His mouth is on mine, and my muscles clench deep inside me. I can hear music faintly. How appropriate. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place as we kiss. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the bedpost. I practically convulse, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. He runs his fingers up my back gently so that desire seizes me with a vengeance. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Oh my</i>. <p>
