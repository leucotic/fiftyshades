Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, raising uncontrollable urges in me. He softly kisses my bottom lip, and my muscles clench deep inside me. I gasp and moan against his lips, and he curls his fingers into my hair, holding me gently in place as we kiss, savagely. My inner goddess is screaming at me. <p> 'On your knees,' he growls, and I comply immediately. <p> That flogger! We've never used a flogger before. I glance nervously at the doorway. His fingers brush the instrument, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. <p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he whispers, pinning me with his bold gaze. Abruptly, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the doorway. I groan loudly, panting, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He softly kisses my throat, and desire and anxiety pump through me. My breathing is too loud.
