Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. I glance nervously at the playroom. His eyes glance over the cuffs, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. <p> 'You were very disobedient,' he murmurs, his voice low, and an electric thrill thrums through me as tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'I want to hear you moan for me. I want to hear you .' His fingers graze my face gently, igniting a fire deep within. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He kisses me, tasting. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and I tingle ... everywhere. Insistent, he softly kisses my throat. The sensual strains of Kings of Leon waft through the air. How unexpected. I moan against his lips, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding me firmly in place. <p> Without warning, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the bedpost. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, making me yearn for him. His hands trail along my body gently. It's pleasure overload. I flush from my head to my toes, humiliated and turned on at the same time. <i>Holy hell</i>.
