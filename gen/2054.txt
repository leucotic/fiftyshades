He runs his nose along my jaw, and my breathing accelerates. His tongue invades my mouth, dominating. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and an electric thrill thrums through me. Insistent, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. His fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss. My subconscious glares at me. <p> 'Get on the bed.' <p> Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> 'You are so beautiful,' he growls, staring intently into my eyes. Catching me off guard, he pushes me against the desk. He holds me against his hips, and it's pleasure overload. He gently trails his hands along my neck. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. How does he have this power over me?
