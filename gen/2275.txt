How can his body do this to me?<p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, insistent, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. Tasting, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, making me squirm, making my muscles clench in response. Holding my head in place as we kiss, his fingers curl into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My inner goddess is screaming at me.
