Without warning, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the wall. My pulse is haywire, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He softly skims his fingertips across my thighs, and desire courses through my blood. I blush scarlet. <i>Holy shit</i>. <p> Leaning down, he kisses me, tasting, sparking electricity ... below. He softly kisses my bottom lip, dominating, raising uncontrollable urges in me. I squirm against him, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place. My inner goddess does a slow erotic dance.
