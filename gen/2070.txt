'You were very disobedient,' he growls. His voice is husky, and I tingle ... everywhere. I glance anxiously at the playroom. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, warmth pooling below my waist. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. The pulsing strains of Kings of Leon waft through the air. How unexpected. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place. <p> He smiles a slow sexy smile. God, he's so fucked-up. His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the wall. I groan loudly, panting, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. His hands softly trail along my body so that I am all sensation. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Shit</i>. <p>
