'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he whispers, his breathing husky, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously as tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes,' I whisper . <p> 'Good girl,' he murmurs, his eyes burning. <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I exhale. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. Dominating, tasting, he kisses me. His mouth is on mine, dominating, anticipation and anxiety charging through me, warmth pooling below my waist. His fingers curl into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. My subconscious is thrilled.
