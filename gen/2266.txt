His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. My heart starts pounding in anticipation. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Do you want to play? ,' he breathes. His eyes are gray, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> 'Please.' I swallow. <p> He smirks. 'I want to hear you moan for me.' He caresses my cheek, gazing at me tenderly, making my muscles clench in response. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, shallowing my breath. His tongue invades my mouth, dominating, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>, making me tremble. He curls his fingers into my hair, holding me firmly in place. My subconscious is screaming at me. <p> Moving suddenly, he shoves me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and my breathing is too loud. His hands trace along my neck so that I am awash with sensation. How can he turn me on with one word?
