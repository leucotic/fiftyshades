Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, exploring, sending delicious shivers down my spine. He kisses me, insistent, igniting a fire deep within. He softly kisses my face, and everything in my body tightens. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting my blood, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. The haunting strains of Tallis waft through the air. How unexpected. Holding me firmly in place, his hand tightens around my hair, fisting his hands. <p> 'On your knees,' he whispers, anticipation and anxiety charging through me and shallowing my breath. <p> His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. <i>Crap</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he breathes, pinning me with his bold gaze. Without warning, he pushes me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and it's so eroticâ€”his need for me. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, forceful, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. I inhale sharply.
