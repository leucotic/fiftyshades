Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the wall. It's so hot, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His hands trail across my body softly. I practically convulse. How can his body do this to me?<p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, making me tremble. He kisses me, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. He softly kisses my cheek, dominating, raising uncontrollable urges in me. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, sending shivers down my spine, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, forcefully. My inner goddess is screaming at me.
