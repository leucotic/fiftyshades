Without warning, he slams me against the desk. He's pinning me to the desk using his hips, and my breathing is too loud. He runs his hands up my belly so that desire courses through my blood. I blush deeply, humiliated and excited at the same time. <i>Oh my</i>. <p> Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, tasting, igniting a fire deep within. He kisses me, and I tingle ... everywhere. Dominating, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, coursing heat throughout my body, sending shivers down my spine. His hand tightens around my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious glares at me.
