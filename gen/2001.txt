Crap. That sex appeal!<p> 'God, I need you,' he whispers as he hovers over me. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my heart starts pounding. His tongue invades my mouth, tasting, dominating. His mouth is on mine, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. He curls his fingers into my hair, pulling my head back. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the doorway. I inhale sharply, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. Lustful, lustful, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. It's pleasure overload. <p>
