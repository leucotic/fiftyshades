'You were very disobedient,' he breathes, his eyes smouldering, and everything in my body tightens as a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I tremble anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> He reaches down, and I'm quaking like a leaf. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, his eyes glowing with lust. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, coursing heat throughout my body, sparking electricity ... below. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and my muscles clench deep inside me. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding me firmly in place. My inner goddess glares at me. <p> His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. <i>Holy crap</i>. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> All of a sudden, he slams me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. His tongue invades my mouth, and desire courses through my blood. I groan, frustrated. <p>
