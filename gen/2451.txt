Abruptly, he shoves me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and my breathing is too loud. His hands trail along my body softly so that desire seizes me with a vengeance. How can his body do this to me?<p> He reaches down, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, insistent, exploring. His mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, my insides liquefying. His eyes glowing with lust, tasting, dominating, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. He kisses me, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. One of his hands moves into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss, frantically. My inner goddess does a slow erotic dance.
