He runs his nose along my jaw, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. He kisses me, dominating, tasting. His tongue invades my mouth, exploring, shallowing my breath, my insides liquefying. He softly kisses my cheek, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. How unexpected. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, fisting his hands. <p> 'On your knees,' he murmurs, and I comply immediately. <p> He grins against my neck. Boy, he's so complicated. That leather strap! We've never used a leather strap before. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'God, I need you,' he whispers, staring intently into my eyes. Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the wall. My breathing is too loud, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He runs his hands along my body gently, and my body rises and fills with my arousal. How can his body do this to me?
