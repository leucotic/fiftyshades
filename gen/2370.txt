Crap. That gaze!<p> 'Keep still,' he breathes, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> He lifts my chin, and my breath hitches. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust. Dominating, tasting, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. His eyes glowing with lust, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. I gasp at his words , and he curls his fingers around my head, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, forcefully. My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the wall. I groan, frustrated, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. His fingers run along my belly gently so that my body rises and fills with my arousal. I flush scarlet, ashamed and excited at the same time. <i>Oh my</i>. <p>
