'Here? ,' he murmurs, his voice low, and my muscles clench deep inside me as everything in my body tightens. I glance nervously at the playroom. <p> He lifts my chin, and I'm quaking like a leaf. His mouth is on mine, tasting, exploring. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and I tingle ... everywhere. Holding me gently in place, his fingers curl into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance. <p> That paddle! We've never used a paddle before. <i>Oh, I want this</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> Without warning, he pushes me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and I inhale sharply. He runs his hands softly across my back so that desire seizes me with a vengeance. I blush scarlet, humiliated and excited at the same time. <i>Holy cow</i>. <p>
