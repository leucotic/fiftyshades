Abruptly, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the desk. My breathing is too loud, making me yearn for him. His mouth is on mine, forceful, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. Fuck, I'm panting already. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, igniting my blood. His mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, sparking electricity ... below, warmth pooling below my waist. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. How appropriate. His fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back.
