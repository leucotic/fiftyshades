'You were very disobedient,' he breathes teasingly, my insides liquefying. I glance anxiously at the doorway. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, sparking electricity ... below. He kisses me, tasting, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. Pulling my head back as we kiss, frantically, his hand tightens around my hair, fisting his hands. <p> That paddle! We've never used a paddle before. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the desk. It's pleasure overload, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. Lustful, his mouth is on mine. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. <p>
