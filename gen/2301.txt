'Do you want to play? ,' he growls, his eyes intense, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me as everything in my body tightens. I glance anxiously at the playroom. <p> Tipping my chin back, his tongue invades my mouth, insistent, igniting a fire deep within. He kisses me, tasting, igniting my blood. His mouth is on mine, dominating, raising uncontrollable urges in me, coursing heat throughout my body. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. I moan against his lips, and he curls his fingers around my head, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. <p> That rope! We've never used rope before. <i>Crap</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> Moving suddenly, he slams me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and fuck, I'm panting already. He skims his hands softly up my body, and my craving spirals out of control. How can his body do this to me?<p>
