His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. <i>Holy crap</i>. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'Do you want me? ,' he whispers. His voice is hard, and tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He caresses my cheek, gazing at me tenderly, coursing heat throughout my body. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, dominating, raising uncontrollable urges in me. He softly kisses my cheek, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I yelp, and his fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss. My inner goddess is screaming at me. <p> Moving suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the desk. My heart is pounding, making me writhe. He softly skims his hands down my belly, and I'm drowning in a pool of desire. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Holy hell</i>.
