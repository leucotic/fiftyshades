'You were very disobedient,' he breathes, his breathing husky, and everything in my body tightens as a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I tremble anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my cheek, dominating, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He softly kisses my throat, insistent, raising uncontrollable urges in me, sending delicious shivers down my spine. His eyes glowing with lust, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. He kisses me, tasting, making my muscles clench in response, sparking electricity ... below. His fingers curl into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious glares at me. <p> His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. <i>I want him so badly</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the doorway. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He skims his fingers gently along my belly so that I am awash with sensation. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Holy shit</i>. <p>
