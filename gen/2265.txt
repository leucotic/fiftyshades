Oh, I want this. That look!<p> 'Keep still,' he whispers as he hovers over me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, dominating, coursing heat throughout my body. His mouth is on mine, and I tingle ... everywhere. I squirm against him, and his hand tightens around my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, savagely. My subconscious is thrilled. <p> Suddenly, he pushes me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and all the air leaves my body. His hands skim down my thighs so that desire and anxiety pump through me. How can he do this to me?<p>
