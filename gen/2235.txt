'Here? ,' he whispers. His breathing is harsh, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, tasting, making me squirm. Insistent, dominating, exploring, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. Insistent, his tongue invades my mouth. He softly kisses my cheek, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, one of his hands moves into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious is thrilled. <p> His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. My heart starts pounding. My mouth goes dry. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> Moving suddenly, he shoves me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and I'm going to combust. He gently runs his fingers down my body, and I surrender briefly to the sensation. How can he do this to me?<p>
