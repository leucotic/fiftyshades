His rope is coiled on the foot of the bed. <i>Holy hell</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'Do you want me? ,' he murmurs, his voice hard, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body as dark desire unfolds throughout my body. <p> 'Okay,' I breathe . <p> His fingers brush my face gently, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. <p> Tipping my chin back, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, dominating, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. His mouth is on mine, exploring, making me tremble. I can hear a song by Miley Cyrus drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I squirm against him, and he curls his fingers around my head, holding me firmly in place as we kiss, savagely. <p> All of a sudden, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the doorway. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me writhe. His fingertips trail across my back softly so that I lose myself to his fervent passion. How does he have this power over me?
