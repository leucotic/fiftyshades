Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. Tasting, exploring, he kisses me. His fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss, savagely. My inner goddess does a slow erotic dance. <p> 'Turn around,' he whispers, and I comply immediately. <p> He grins against my neck. Boy, he's so complicated. That paddle! We've never used a paddle before. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'You. Are. So. Beautiful,' he growls, pinning me with his bold gaze. Moving suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the bedpost. It's pleasure overload, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. Forceful, his eyes wild, he softly kisses my face. I'm going to combust.
