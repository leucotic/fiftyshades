'You were very disobedient,' he breathes, his breathing husky, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body as a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I tremble anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, insistent, sparking electricity ... below. He kisses me, and everything in my body tightens. The sensual strains of Tallis waft through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. He curls his fingers around my head, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. <p> His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. My breathing accelerates. His eyes glance over the paddle, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the desk. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. His tongue invades my mouth, exploring, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. It's so hot. <p>
