Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. I'm quaking like a leaf. Boy, he's so fucked-up. <p> 'Here? ,' he breathes, his voice husky, and my muscles clench deep inside me as tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Please...' I whisper . <p> He smirks. 'Good girl.' He caresses my cheek, gazing at me lovingly, making me tremble. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my breathing accelerates. He softly kisses my temple, insistent, his eyes glowing with lust. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and I tingle ... everywhere. His eyes glowing with lust, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. He softly kisses my throat, tasting, my insides liquefying. I gasp and moan , and his hand tightens around my hair, pulling my head back. My subconscious is thrilled. <p> Suddenly, he slams me against the bedpost. He's pinning me to the bedpost using his hips, and I groan, frustrated. He gently skims his fingers along my body so that desire and anxiety pump through me. How can he do this to me?
