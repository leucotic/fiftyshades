Holy shit. That gaze!<p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he breathes, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> He leans in, and I'm quaking like a leaf. His mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, sparking electricity ... below, raising uncontrollable urges in me. His fingers curl into my hair, holding me gently in place as we kiss, forcefully. My subconscious does the samba. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the wall. I groan, frustrated, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. Forceful, his eyes wild, he softly kisses my temple. My pulse is haywire. <p>
