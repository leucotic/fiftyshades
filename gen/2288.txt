Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the bedpost. It's pleasure overload, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. He trails his fingertips gently up my belly. My pulse is haywire. How can he turn me on with one word?<p> Tipping my chin back, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, igniting a fire deep within. His mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, making my muscles clench in response, raising uncontrollable urges in me. I yelp, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place as we kiss, savagely. My subconscious is purring with pleasure.
