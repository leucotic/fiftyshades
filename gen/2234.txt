Holy hell. That power!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he breathes, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my bottom lip, insistent, igniting a fire deep within. His mouth is on mine, and everything in my body tightens. He kisses me, tasting, making me squirm, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, he curls his fingers around my head, holding tight. My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> Catching me off guard, he slams me against the desk. He holds me against his hips, and I inhale sharply. He softly kisses my face, and I am all sensation. It's pleasure overload. <p>
