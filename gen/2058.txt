'You were very disobedient,' he murmurs in my ear, making my muscles clench in response. I glance nervously at the playroom. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my face, tasting, igniting a fire deep within. Insistent, his eyes glowing with lust, exploring, he kisses me. His mouth is on mine, and I tingle ... everywhere. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, raising uncontrollable urges in me. He curls his fingers into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance. <p> That flogger! We've never used a flogger before. My heart skips a beat. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> Moving suddenly, he shoves me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and all the air leaves my body. His fingertips softly skim across my back. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me. How can his body do this to me?<p>
