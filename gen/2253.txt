He runs his nose along my jaw, and my breathing accelerates. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, making me tremble, warmth pooling below my waist. I can hear a song by Justin Bieber drifting through the air. I love his choice. Pulling my head back, he grabs my hair and yanks down, running his fingers through my hair. <p> 'Get on the bed.' <p> He stalks gracefully forward. Boy, he's so complicated. His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Keep still,' he growls as he hovers over me. Moving suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the wall. I groan, frustrated, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He softly kisses my throat, frantic, making me yearn for him. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me.
