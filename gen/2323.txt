Those nipple clamps! We've never used a pair of nipple clamps before. <i>Holy shit</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> 'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he murmurs, his gaze darkening, and I tingle ... everywhere as a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> His lips tense. 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you.' He caresses my cheek, gazing at me tenderly, igniting a fire deep within. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my cheek, tasting, igniting my blood. His mouth is on mine, dominating, making me tremble, shallowing my breath. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place as we kiss. My inner goddess glares at me. <p> Without warning, he pushes me against the desk. He's pinning me to the desk using his hips, and I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. He kisses me, exploring, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. I'm going to combust.
