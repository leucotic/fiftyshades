Suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the desk. My breathing is too loud, making me writhe, making me writhe. His mouth is on mine, forceful, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. My breathing is too loud. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, tasting, sparking electricity ... below. He softly kisses my throat, and my muscles clench deep inside me. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, igniting a fire deep within. I yelp, and his hand tightens around my hair, pulling my head back. My subconscious is staring at me in awe.
