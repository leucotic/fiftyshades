'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he whispers in my ear, coursing heat throughout my body. I glance anxiously at the playroom. <p> Tipping my chin back, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, dominating, making me tremble. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. He softly kisses my temple, and everything in my body tightens. Exploring, tasting, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. I squirm against him, and he curls his fingers around my head, holding me firmly in place. My inner goddess does the samba. <p> His rope is coiled on the foot of the bed. <i>Holy shit</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the wall. I inhale sharply, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. Lustful, his eyes wild, his mouth is on mine. I groan loudly, panting. <p>
