'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he growls, his voice hard, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body as I tingle ... everywhere. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> His lips tense. 'Tell me what you want.' <p> 'Surprise me,' I exhale. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, exploring, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. His mouth is on mine, tasting, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>, coursing heat throughout my body. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, anticipation and anxiety charging through me, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. One of his hands moves into my hair, holding my head in place. My inner goddess does a slow erotic dance.
