He runs his nose along my forehead, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, tasting. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting a fire deep within, raising uncontrollable urges in me. The haunting strains of Miley Cyrus waft through the air. How appropriate. Holding my head in place as we kiss, one of his hands moves into my hair, fisting his hands. <p> 'Get on the bed,' he murmurs, and I comply immediately. <p> He smirks at me. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'You are so beautiful,' he whispers as he hovers over me. Moving suddenly, he shoves me against the doorway. He holds me against his hips, and it's pleasure overload. He traces his fingers down my back so that my body rises and fills with my arousal. How can his body do this to me?
