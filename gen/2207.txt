I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> 'Do you want me? ,' he growls, his voice hard, and a delicious tingling shoots through me as an electric thrill thrums through me. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' I swallow. <p> He touches my face gently, igniting a fire deep within. <p> He leans in, and my stomach somersaults. He softly kisses my bottom lip, insistent, dominating. He softly kisses my throat, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. His tongue invades my mouth, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. His eyes glowing with lust, tasting, tasting, he softly kisses my face. Holding my head in place, his fingers curl into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious is staring at me in awe. <p> Abruptly, he pushes me against the wall. He restrains me with his hips, and I groan, frustrated. He trails his fingers across my body, and desire seizes me with a vengeance. I blush scarlet. <i>Oh, I want this</i>.
