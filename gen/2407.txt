'Ready?,' he murmurs, his voice harsh, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me as I tingle ... everywhere. <p> 'Yes,' I exhale . <p> 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you,' he whispers, his breathing husky. <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I breathe. <p> He reaches down, and my breathing accelerates. His mouth is on mine, dominating, insistent. His tongue invades my mouth, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. He curls his fingers into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My inner goddess does the samba.
