He straightens. If only it didn't take a contract and rope to satisfy him. That rope! We've never used rope before. His fingers brush the coil, and my muscles clench deep inside me. <p> 'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he growls. His voice is low, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes,' I breathe . <p> He touches my face gently, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, exploring, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. He softly kisses my throat, and tingling shoots through me. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, making me tremble, making me squirm. I can hear a song by Kings of Leon drifting through the air. How appropriate. Holding my head in place as we kiss, savagely, his fingers curl into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. <p> Without warning, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the desk. I practically convulse, making me yearn for him, making me yearn for him. His fingers gently trace down my neck so that I lose myself to his fervent passion. I blush scarlet. <i>Holy cow</i>.
