He smiles a slow sexy smile. Boy, he's so fucked-up. That paddle! We've never used a paddle before. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Ready?,' he growls in my ear, my insides liquefying. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes,' I whisper . <p> He caresses my hair, gazing at me lovingly, coursing heat throughout my body. <p> He reaches down, and my breath hitches. He kisses me, insistent, tasting. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and an electric thrill thrums through me. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting a fire deep within, my insides liquefying. I can hear a song by Justin Bieber drifting through the air. I love his choice. I squirm against him, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the doorway. I groan loudly, panting, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He trails his hands softly along my back, and I surrender briefly to the sensation. I flush deeply, humiliated and excited at the same time. <i>Holy crap</i>.
