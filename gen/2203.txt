Holy hell. That power!<p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he growls as he hovers over me. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, making my muscles clench in response. He softly kisses my throat, exploring, anticipation and anxiety charging through me, making me tremble. He kisses me, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, pulling my head back. <p> Without warning, he pushes me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and I groan, frustrated. He gently trails his fingers across my back so that desire and anxiety pump through me. I blush , feeling my face flame. <i>Holy shit</i>. <p>
