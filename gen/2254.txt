Catching me off guard, he shoves me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and I inhale sharply. His hands skim along my thighs so that I lose myself to his fervent passion. How can he turn me on with one word?<p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my breath hitches. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, his eyes glowing with lust. His mouth is on mine, and an electric thrill thrums through me. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, igniting a fire deep within, warmth pooling below my waist. I moan into his mouth, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding me firmly in place. My subconscious is thrilled.
