'You were very disobedient,' he murmurs, his gaze darkening, and my muscles clench deep inside me as I tingle ... everywhere. I glance anxiously at the playroom. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, sparking electricity ... below. He softly kisses my face, and tingling shoots through me. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, warmth pooling below my waist. Exploring, tasting, his eyes glowing with lust, he kisses me. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. Holding me gently in place, his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, fisting his hands. <p> His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. <i>I want him so badly</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> Without warning, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the wall. I inhale sharply, making me writhe, making me writhe. His hands softly trail along my thighs so that I lose myself to his fervent passion. I flush from my head to my toes, humiliated and excited at the same time. <i>Oh my</i>. <p>
