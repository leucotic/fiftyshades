'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he whispers, his breathing low, and everything in my body tightens as everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. My stomach somersaults. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my breath hitches. He kisses me, insistent. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and I tingle ... everywhere. Pulling my head back as we kiss, savagely, his fingers curl into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My inner goddess has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly. <p> His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. I tremble anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the desk. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His mouth is on mine, forceful, making me writhe. My pulse is haywire. <p>
