'You were very disobedient,' he whispers, his breathing harsh, and everything in my body tightens as my muscles clench deep inside me. I glance nervously at the doorway. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, sending delicious shivers down my spine. Tasting, dominating, tasting, his tongue invades my mouth. His eyes glowing with lust, he softly kisses my temple. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. I squirm against him, and his fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back. <p> His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. I glance nervously at the playroom. If only it didn't take a contract and a paddle to please him. <p> Abruptly, he slams me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and it's so hot. His hands run along my thighs gently so that my body rises and fills with my arousal. I blush scarlet, ashamed and excited at the same time. <i>Shit</i>. <p>
