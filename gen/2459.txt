'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he whispers teasingly, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. I glance anxiously at the bed. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, dominating, making me squirm. His tongue invades my mouth, and everything in my body tightens. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting my blood, making my muscles clench in response. Insistent, he softly kisses my throat. I can hear music faintly. How unexpected. I yelp, and he curls his fingers around my head, holding my head in place as we kiss. <p> Those nipple clamps! We've never used a pair of nipple clamps before. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> Moving suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the bedpost. I'm going to combust, making me writhe, making me writhe. He kisses me, his eyes wild, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. It's so hot. <p>
