Holy hell. That gaze!<p> 'Keep still,' he breathes as he hovers over me. <p> He leans in, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. His mouth is on mine, dominating, exploring. He softly kisses my throat, and everything in my body tightens. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, warmth pooling below my waist. I can hear a song by Miley Cyrus drifting through the air. How unexpected. I yelp, and his hand tightens around my hair, holding me gently in place. <p> All of a sudden, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the desk. I groan loudly, panting, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. He softly kisses my face, his eyes wild, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. It's so hot. <p>
