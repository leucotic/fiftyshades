That leather strap! We've never used a leather strap before. <i>Crap</i>. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'Do you want me? ,' he murmurs. His breathing is hard, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes...' I exhale . <p> His fingers graze my face gently, my insides liquefying. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my face, insistent, igniting a fire deep within. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. Tasting, dominating, his mouth is on mine. His fingers curl into my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss, savagely. My inner goddess swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> Without warning, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the bedpost. My breathing is too loud, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. His fingertips gently skim up my thighs so that my craving spirals out of control. How can he turn me on with one word?
