'Here? ,' he murmurs. His breathing is harsh, and everything in my body tightens. My breathing accelerates. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, warmth pooling below my waist. Dominating, he softly kisses my temple. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, frantically, he grabs my hair and yanks down, running his fingers through my hair. My inner goddess is thrilled. <p> His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. I shiver anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the wall. I inhale sharply, making me yearn for him, making me yearn for him. He traces his hands down my thighs. I groan, frustrated. How can he do this to me?<p>
