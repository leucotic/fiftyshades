'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he murmurs in my ear, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. <p> 'Okay.' I swallow. <p> 'Good,' he whispers, his breathing husky. <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I breathe. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, sparking electricity ... below. His tongue invades my mouth, insistent, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. His mouth is on mine, tasting, my insides liquefying. He kisses me, dominating, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding my head in place as we kiss. My subconscious does the samba.
