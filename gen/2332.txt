'Ready?,' he whispers. His breathing is harsh, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. <p> 'Yes...' I breathe . <p> 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you. Tell me what you want.' <p> 'Surprise me,' I whisper. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my temple, his eyes glowing with lust, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and my muscles clench deep inside me. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, making me squirm, making me tremble. He kisses me, insistent, sending delicious shivers down my spine, shallowing my breath. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. Holding me gently in place as we kiss, savagely, he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding tight.
