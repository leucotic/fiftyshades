Holy cow. That gaze!<p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he growls as he hovers over me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, exploring, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. He softly kisses my cheek, and everything in my body tightens. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, frantically, his hand tightens around my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly. <p> Moving suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the doorway. It's so hot, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. His fingers softly trace down my belly. I groan loudly, panting. How can his body do this to me?<p>
