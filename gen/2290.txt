Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the bedpost. My breathing is too loud, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His fingers softly skim across my body. I groan, frustrated. I blush from my head to my toes. <i>Crap</i>. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my throat, insistent, making me tremble. His mouth is on mine, insistent, sending delicious shivers down my spine, warmth pooling below my waist. He kisses me, insistent, making me squirm, shallowing my breath. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and tingling shoots through me. Holding me firmly in place, his fingers curl into my hair, fisting his hands. My inner goddess does the samba.
