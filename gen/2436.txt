His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. <i>Holy hell</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'Do you want me? ,' he breathes in my ear, warmth pooling below my waist. <p> 'Okay.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He touches my face gently, raising uncontrollable urges in me. <p> He lifts my chin, and my heart starts pounding. He kisses me, tasting. He kisses me, insistent, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside, sparking electricity ... below. His mouth is on mine, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. The haunting strains of Miley Cyrus waft through the air. I love his choice. He curls his fingers into my hair, pulling my head back. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the desk. It's pleasure overload, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He trails his fingertips along my back so that desire courses through my blood. How can he do this to me?
