Shit. That look!<p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he growls, staring intently into my eyes. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my stomach somersaults. He softly kisses my throat, tasting, insistent, insistent. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, igniting a fire deep within. I can hear a song by Miley Cyrus drifting through the air. How unexpected. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, his fingers curl into my hair, fisting his hands. <p> Moving suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the desk. I groan, frustrated, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His fingertips skim across my belly gently so that my body rises and fills with my arousal. I blush scarlet. <i>Holy hell</i>. <p>
