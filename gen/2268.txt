Suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the bedpost. I inhale sharply, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. He softly kisses my cheek, his eyes wild, making me writhe. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, making me squirm. He softly kisses my throat, insistent, coursing heat throughout my body, sparking electricity ... below. I yelp, and his fingers curl into my hair, holding me gently in place as we kiss. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves.
