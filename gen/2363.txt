'You were very disobedient,' he breathes. His eyes are softly luminous in the diffuse glow of the lamp, and everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Okay,' I whisper . <p> 'Tell me what you want,' he whispers, his gaze smoky. <p> 'Surprise me,' I exhale. <p> Tipping my chin back, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, tasting, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. His mouth is on mine, and everything in my body tightens. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, making me squirm, raising uncontrollable urges in me. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss, savagely.
