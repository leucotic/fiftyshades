'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he growls in my ear, igniting my blood. <p> 'Okay.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'Good girl. Good.' <p> 'Surprise me,' I breathe. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, exploring, igniting a fire deep within. His tongue invades my mouth, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. His mouth is on mine, dominating, warmth pooling below my waist, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. I gasp and moan against his lips, and he curls his fingers into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My inner goddess is screaming at me.
