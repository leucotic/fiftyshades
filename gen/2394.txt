Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the desk. I groan loudly, panting, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and my craving spirals out of control. My breathing is too loud. <p> He leans in, and my breath hitches. He softly kisses my face, exploring, dominating, his eyes glowing with lust. Insistent, dominating, insistent, he kisses me. He softly kisses my temple, and I tingle ... everywhere. I gasp and moan , and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place. My subconscious is thrilled.
