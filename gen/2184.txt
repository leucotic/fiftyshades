He grins against my neck. If only it didn't take a contract and a flogger to satisfy him. His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'You were very disobedient,' he whispers. His breathing is hard, and tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Okay.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'Tell me what you want. Good girl.' He caresses my hair, gazing at me lovingly, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my breath hitches. His tongue invades my mouth, dominating, tasting, insistent. His mouth is on mine, and I tingle ... everywhere. Dominating, dominating, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. Tasting, his eyes glowing with lust, he kisses me. I can hear music faintly. How unexpected. Holding my head in place, one of his hands moves into my hair, fisting his hands. <p> Suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the wall. My heart is pounding, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. His hands softly trail along my back. My heart is pounding. I blush from my head to my toes, humiliated and excited at the same time. <i>Holy crap</i>.
