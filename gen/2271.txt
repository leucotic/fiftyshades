'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he breathes, his breathing hard, and everything in my body tightens as I tingle ... everywhere. <p> 'Okay.' I swallow. <p> He smirks. 'This is not going to hurt. It will be intense.' <p> 'Surprise me,' I breathe. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my temple, his eyes glowing with lust, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. Insistent, dominating, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. Insistent, tasting, exploring, he kisses me. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and my muscles clench deep inside me. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding me firmly in place. My subconscious is staring at me in awe.
