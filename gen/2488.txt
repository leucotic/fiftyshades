Without warning, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the desk. It's pleasure overload, making me yearn for him. He softly trails his hands down my neck, and I am all sensation. How can he turn me on with one word?<p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, exploring, coursing heat throughout my body. His mouth is on mine, tasting, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, warmth pooling below my waist, coursing heat throughout my body. He kisses me, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. His fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss, frantically. My inner goddess swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head.
