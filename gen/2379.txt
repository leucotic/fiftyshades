'Ready?,' he murmurs. His eyes are softly luminous in the diffuse glow of the lamp, and I tingle ... everywhere. I glance nervously at the playroom. <p> He reaches down, and my stomach somersaults. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent. His tongue invades my mouth, dominating, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, my insides liquefying. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, igniting a fire deep within. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, savagely, his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding tight. My subconscious glares at me. <p> He straightens. Boy, he's so hard to please. His rope is coiled on the foot of the bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Moving suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the wall. It's so hot, making me yearn for him. He runs his fingers down my neck, and desire seizes me with a vengeance. How can he do this to me?<p>
