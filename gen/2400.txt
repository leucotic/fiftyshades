I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he murmurs, his voice low, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously as a delicious tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Okay.'

His tongue invades my mouth, dominating, insistent. He kisses me, tasting, igniting a fire deep within, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. Insistent, exploring, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. Pulling my head back, his fingers curl into my hair, fisting his hands. My inner goddess has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly. <p> Without warning, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the wall. Fuck, I'm panting already, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He runs his hands across my thighs. I'm going to combust. How can his body do this to me?
