Crap. That sex appeal!<p> 'You. Are. So. Beautiful,' he breathes, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> He lifts my chin, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. He kisses me, dominating, his eyes glowing with lust. Dominating, insistent, tasting, his mouth is on mine. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and an electric thrill thrums through me. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, fisting his hands. My inner goddess is purring with pleasure. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the bedpost. My pulse is haywire, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and my body rises and fills with my arousal. I groan loudly, panting. <p>
