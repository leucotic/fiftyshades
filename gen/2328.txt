Holy crap. That gaze!<p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he growls, staring intently into my eyes. <p> Leaning down, his tongue invades my mouth, insistent, shallowing my breath. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, raising uncontrollable urges in me, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. The pulsing strains of Miley Cyrus waft through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place as we kiss. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the wall. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. He skims his fingers down my body, and desire and anxiety pump through me. I flush from my head to my toes, ashamed and excited at the same time. <i>Holy hell</i>. <p>
