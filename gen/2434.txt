'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he breathes in my ear, shallowing my breath. I'm quaking like a leaf. <p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and my heart skips a beat. He softly kisses my temple, insistent, tasting. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. Dominating, his mouth is on mine. Pulling my head back as we kiss, savagely, he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding tight. My subconscious is thrilled. <p> He smiles a slow sexy smile. Jeez, he's so complicated. His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the desk. It's so hot, making me yearn for him. He runs his hands up my neck gently. I inhale sharply. How does he have this power over me?<p>
