Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the doorway. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He kisses me, and my body rises and fills with my arousal. It's so hot. <p> Leaning down, his tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. Tasting, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. He kisses me, exploring, shallowing my breath, making my muscles clench in response. His mouth is on mine, and everything in my body tightens. I squirm against him, and he curls his fingers around my head, holding my head in place. My subconscious is staring at me in awe.
