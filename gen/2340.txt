'Ready?,' he whispers. His eyes are burning brighter, and I tingle ... everywhere. <p> 'Okay,' I exhale . <p> 'Good girl. This is not going to hurt. It will be intense.' <p> 'Take me,' I whisper. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, coursing heat throughout my body. He softly kisses my face, his eyes glowing with lust, warmth pooling below my waist. His hand tightens around my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss, savagely. My inner goddess does a slow erotic dance.
