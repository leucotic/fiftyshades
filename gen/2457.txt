'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he growls. His breathing is husky, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. <p> 'Okay,' I exhale . <p> His lips twitch. 'This is not going to hurt. It will be intense.' <p> 'Surprise me,' I breathe. <p> He lifts my chin, and my heart skips a beat. He softly kisses my throat, tasting, insistent. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. He kisses me, exploring, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. He softly kisses my face, his eyes glowing with lust, anticipation and anxiety charging through me, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. I yelp, and he curls his fingers into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves.
