'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he murmurs, his voice low, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body as a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes,' I breathe . <p> He smiles teasingly. 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you.' <p> 'Take me,' I exhale. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my breathing accelerates. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust. His eyes glowing with lust, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. His mouth is on mine, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. Dominating, tasting, insistent, he kisses me. I gasp at his words , and he grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves.
