'Do you want me? ,' he murmurs, his breathing husky, and my muscles clench deep inside me as everything in my body tightens. I glance nervously at the playroom. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my face, exploring, coursing heat throughout my body. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. He softly kisses my bottom lip, tasting, shallowing my breath. He grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My inner goddess is staring at me in awe. <p> Those nipple clamps! We've never used a pair of nipple clamps before. <i>Oh my</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> Catching me off guard, he pushes me against the bedpost. He's pinning me to the bedpost using his hips, and I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. His fingertips trail up my neck. My pulse is haywire. I flush from my head to my toes, humiliated and turned on at the same time. <i>Holy hell</i>. <p>
