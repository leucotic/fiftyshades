'Here? ,' he whispers, his breathing harsh, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me as my muscles clench deep inside me. <p> 'Please.' I swallow. <p> 'Tell me what you want,' he murmurs, his eyes scorching. <p> 'Take me,' I breathe. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, igniting a fire deep within. His tongue invades my mouth, dominating, igniting a fire deep within. He kisses me, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I moan again into his mouth, and he curls his fingers into my hair, holding my head in place. My inner goddess is screaming at me.
