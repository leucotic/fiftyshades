His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. <i>Shit</i>. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'Here? ,' he breathes in my ear, coursing heat throughout my body. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' I swallow. <p> 'Remember, I'll never hurt you. I want to hear you scream for me.' He caresses my cheek, gazing at me lovingly, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. <p> He reaches down, and I'm quaking like a leaf. His tongue invades my mouth, tasting, exploring. His mouth is on mine, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I can hear a song by Kings of Leon drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I bite my lip, and his fingers curl into my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss, forcefully. <p> Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the doorway. I inhale sharply, making me writhe. He traces his fingers gently up my body. All the air leaves my body. How does he have this power over me?
