'You were very disobedient,' he whispers, his voice hard, and an electric thrill thrums through me as everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'Good. Tell me what you want.' <p> 'Surprise me,' I breathe. <p> He leans in, and my breathing accelerates. He kisses me, dominating, tasting, his eyes glowing with lust. His mouth is on mine, insistent, warmth pooling below my waist, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. He softly kisses my throat, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. His mouth is on mine, dominating, sparking electricity ... below, making me tremble. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding me firmly in place. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance.
