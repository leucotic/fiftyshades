'Do you want to play? ,' he murmurs in my ear, coursing heat throughout my body. <p> 'Yes...' I breathe . <p> 'I want to hear you . Good.' <p> 'Take me,' I whisper. <p> Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, exploring, warmth pooling below my waist. He kisses me, tasting, making me tremble. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. He curls his fingers around my head, pulling my head back as we kiss, frantically.
