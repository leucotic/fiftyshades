Without warning, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the wall. It's so hot, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. Lustful, exploring, his tongue invades my mouth. My pulse is haywire. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my cheek, insistent, making my muscles clench in response. He kisses me, and an electric thrill thrums through me. Dominating, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. I can hear music faintly. How appropriate. His fingers curl into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face.
