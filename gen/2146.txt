Oh, I want this. That look!<p> 'Keep still,' he breathes as he hovers over me. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my face, tasting, shallowing my breath. His eyes glowing with lust, his mouth is on mine. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. I squirm against him, and one of his hands moves into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, frantically. <p> Abruptly, he shoves me against the bedpost. He holds me against his hips, and I'm going to combust. He skims his hands down my body gently so that my body rises and fills with my arousal. How can his body do this to me?<p>
