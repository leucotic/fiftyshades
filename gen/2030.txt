'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he murmurs teasingly, making me tremble. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes...' I exhale . <p> 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you. This is not going to hurt. It will be intense.' <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I breathe. <p> Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, tasting, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. Dominating, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. He softly kisses my face, dominating, making me squirm, coursing heat throughout my body. Holding my head in place as we kiss, frantically, one of his hands moves into my hair, fisting his hands. My subconscious has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly.
