'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he murmurs. His voice is harsh, and an electric thrill thrums through me. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> His lips part. 'Good.' <p> 'Take me,' I breathe. <p> He lifts my chin, and my breath hitches. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, insistent, dominating. Tasting, exploring, his mouth is on mine. He kisses me, and tingling shoots through me. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, he curls his fingers into my hair, running his fingers through my hair.
