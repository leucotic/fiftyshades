He leans in, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. He softly kisses my throat, tasting. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, igniting my blood. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. His fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss, forcefully. My subconscious has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly. <p> 'Get on the bed.' <p> He straightens. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'You. Are. So. Beautiful,' he growls, staring intently into my eyes. Catching me off guard, he pushes me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and my heart is pounding. He runs his fingertips down my neck gently so that I surrender briefly to the sensation. How does he have this power over me?
