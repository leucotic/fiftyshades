'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he breathes teasingly, making me squirm. I'm quaking like a leaf. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, exploring, coursing heat throughout my body. His mouth is on mine, tasting, warmth pooling below my waist, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. His eyes glowing with lust, tasting, he softly kisses my throat. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, igniting my blood, igniting a fire deep within. The pulsing strains of Kings of Leon drift through the headphones he put on me. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss. <p> His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. <i>Holy hell</i>. His eyes glance over the strap, and tingling shoots through me. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the doorway. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His mouth is on mine, and desire seizes me with a vengeance. Fuck, I'm panting already. <p>
