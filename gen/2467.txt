Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the wall. My breathing is too loud, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He skims his hands across my thighs gently so that desire courses through my blood. How can he turn me on with one word?<p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, making me tremble. His mouth is on mine, and tingling shoots through me. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, anticipation and anxiety charging through me, raising uncontrollable urges in me. His hand tightens around my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss. My subconscious is staring at me in awe.
