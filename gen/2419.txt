Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my face, tasting, shallowing my breath. Exploring, his eyes glowing with lust, insistent, he softly kisses my temple. He curls his fingers around my head, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. My inner goddess is screaming at me. <p> 'On your knees,' he whispers, igniting a fire deep within and igniting my blood. <p> He straightens. If only it didn't take a contract and a flogger to satisfy him. His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Keep still,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. All of a sudden, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the bedpost. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me writhe. His hands trail across my thighs so that I am all sensation. How can his body do this to me?
