'Do you want to play? ,' he growls, his voice husky, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me as everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He smiles twistedly. 'I want to hear you moan for me.' <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I exhale. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, dominating, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. Tasting, insistent, he kisses me. His mouth is on mine, and my muscles clench deep inside me. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, coursing heat throughout my body. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, savagely, his fingers curl into my hair, fisting his hands. My inner goddess swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head.
