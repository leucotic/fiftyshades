Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, coursing heat throughout my body. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, raising uncontrollable urges in me, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He softly kisses my bottom lip, and everything in my body tightens. He curls his fingers into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> 'Turn around.' <p> He grins against my neck. God, he's so complicated. His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the bedpost. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me, making me yearn for him. He skims his fingers gently along my body. I practically convulse. How can his body do this to me?
