Catching me off guard, he slams me against the desk. He restrains me with his hips, and it's so eroticâ€”his need for me. His hands trail up my body, and I'm drowning in a pool of desire. How can he do this to me?<p> He lifts my chin, and my breath hitches. His mouth is on mine, tasting. He kisses me, dominating, warmth pooling below my waist. Pulling my head back, he curls his fingers into my hair, holding tight. My subconscious has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly.
