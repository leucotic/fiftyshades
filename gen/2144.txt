He leans in, and my stomach somersaults. He kisses me, insistent, insistent, insistent. He kisses me, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. His eyes glowing with lust, dominating, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. I gasp and moan against his lips, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding me firmly in place as we kiss, savagely. My inner goddess is screaming at me. <p> 'Get on the bed.' <p> He stalks gracefully forward. If only it didn't take a contract and a flogger to please him. His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'You. Are. So. Beautiful,' he breathes as he hovers over me. Without warning, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the wall. I groan, frustrated, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His hands run along my belly, and I lose myself to his fervent passion. How does he have this power over me?
