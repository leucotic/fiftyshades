Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the doorway. It's pleasure overload, making me writhe. His fingertips run down my belly. My breathing is too loud. How can he turn me on with one word?<p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and my heart skips a beat. He softly kisses my temple, exploring, dominating. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. His mouth is on mine, exploring, coursing heat throughout my body. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, pulling my head back. My inner goddess swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head.
