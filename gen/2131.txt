'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he growls. His breathing is harsh, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes,' I breathe . <p> 'Tell me what you want,' he murmurs, his breathing hard. <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I whisper. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my heart skips a beat. His tongue invades my mouth, exploring, insistent, tasting. His mouth is on mine, dominating, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. I love his choice. His fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss.
