Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, exploring, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. He softly kisses my cheek, tasting, igniting a fire deep within, warmth pooling below my waist. Exploring, his eyes glowing with lust, insistent, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, dominating, coursing heat throughout my body. I can hear a song by Justin Bieber drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. <p> 'Turn around,' he murmurs, shallowing my breath and making me tremble. <p> He grins against my neck. Jeez, he's so hard to please. Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he whispers, staring intently into my eyes. Moving suddenly, he shoves me against the bedpost. He restrains me with his hips, and my heart is pounding. He runs his fingers down my back gently so that I lose myself to his fervent passion. How can he do this to me?
