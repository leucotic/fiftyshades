'You were very disobedient,' he whispers, his voice harsh, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously as tingling shoots through me. I'm quaking like a leaf. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, making my muscles clench in response. He kisses me, and an electric thrill thrums through me. Holding my head in place, he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding tight. My subconscious has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly. <p> That paddle! We've never used a paddle before. <i>I want him so badly</i>. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the bedpost. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me yearn for him. He runs his fingers gently up my thighs, and my craving spirals out of control. How can he do this to me?<p>
