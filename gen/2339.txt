Crap. That sex appeal!<p> 'Keep still,' he breathes as he hovers over me. <p> He reaches down, and my stomach somersaults. He kisses me, exploring. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and an electric thrill thrums through me. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, igniting my blood, making me tremble. He kisses me, tasting, coursing heat throughout my body, warmth pooling below my waist. Holding my head in place, he curls his fingers around my head, fisting his hands. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance. <p> Catching me off guard, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the desk. I groan, frustrated, making me yearn for him. He runs his fingers softly up my back. My breathing is too loud. How can he turn me on with one word?<p>
