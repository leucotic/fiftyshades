Shit. That gaze!<p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he breathes as he hovers over me. <p> Tipping my chin back, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, sending shivers down my spine. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, making me tremble. I squirm against him, and his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, pulling my head back. My subconscious does the samba. <p> Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the desk. I groan loudly, panting, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. He trails his fingers up my thighs gently, and I am awash with sensation. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Crap</i>. <p>
