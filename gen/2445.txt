Oh, I want this. That look!<p> 'I want you so much,' he breathes, staring intently into my eyes. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, exploring, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. He softly kisses my bottom lip, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. I moan again , and one of his hands moves into my hair, holding me firmly in place. <p> Suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the doorway. My heart is pounding, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, frantic, making me yearn for him. I groan loudly, panting. <p>
