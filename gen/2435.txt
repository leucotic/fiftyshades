His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. I glance anxiously at the playroom. My mouth goes dry. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> 'Ready?,' he whispers, his voice husky, and everything in my body tightens as dark desire unfolds throughout my body. <p> 'Yes...' I whisper . <p> His fingers graze my face gently, raising uncontrollable urges in me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, making me squirm. Dominating, he softly kisses my bottom lip. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding my head in place. My inner goddess is staring at me in awe. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the desk. I practically convulse, making me writhe, making me writhe. He trails his hands across my back softly, and I lose myself to his fervent passion. How can he do this to me?
