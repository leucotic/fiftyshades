That paddle! We've never used a paddle before. <i>Holy crap</i>. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Here? ,' he breathes, his gaze scorching, and tingling shoots through me as everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. <p> 'Yes...' I exhale . <p> He smiles teasingly. 'Good.' His fingers graze my face gently, warmth pooling below my waist. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, igniting a fire deep within. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. Insistent, exploring, he softly kisses my throat. Insistent, dominating, dominating, his mouth is on mine. I can hear music faintly. How unexpected. I squirm against him, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the wall. My breathing is too loud, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He runs his fingers up my thighs so that my body rises and fills with my arousal. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>I want him so badly</i>.
