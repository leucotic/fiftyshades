'Do you want me? ,' he whispers, his breathing harsh, and desire unfurls deep in my belly as everything in my body tightens. My heart skips a beat. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my face, tasting, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. His mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, shallowing my breath. The haunting strains of Kings of Leon drift through the headphones he put on me. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I yelp, and his fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss, frantically. <p> He stalks gracefully forward. My mouth goes dry. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. That flogger! We've never used a flogger before. His eyes glance over the instrument, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. <p> All of a sudden, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the desk. My breathing is too loud, making me writhe, making me writhe. He gently trails his fingers up my body so that desire seizes me with a vengeance. How can his body do this to me?<p>
