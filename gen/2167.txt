His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I glance nervously at the playroom. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he growls. His eyes are burning, and everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Yes...' I exhale . <p> He smirks. 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you.' He cups my face gently, raising uncontrollable urges in me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my face, his eyes glowing with lust, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. He kisses me, and I tingle ... everywhere. His eyes glowing with lust, his mouth is on mine. I can hear a song by Kings of Leon drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. Holding my head in place, one of his hands moves into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. <p> Catching me off guard, he pushes me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and I groan, frustrated. Lustful, his eyes wild, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. I practically convulse.
