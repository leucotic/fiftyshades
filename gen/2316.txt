Crap. That sex appeal!<p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, coursing heat throughout my body. He softly kisses my temple, and my muscles clench deep inside me. Dominating, insistent, his eyes glowing with lust, his tongue invades my mouth. He softly kisses my cheek, insistent, making me tremble. His fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss, savagely. My inner goddess is purring with pleasure. <p> Suddenly, he slams me against the doorway. He restrains me with his hips, and my pulse is haywire. His fingertips skim along my belly gently. All the air leaves my body. How does he have this power over me?<p>
