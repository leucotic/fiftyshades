He smiles a slow sexy smile. If only it didn't take a contract and a pair of handcuffs to satisfy him. His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. His eyes glance over the cuffs, and my muscles clench deep inside me. <p> 'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he breathes, his breathing husky, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me as everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He caresses my cheek, gazing at me lovingly, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, insistent, making me squirm. He softly kisses my cheek, tasting, making me tremble. The sensual strains of Miley Cyrus drift through the headphones he put on me. I love his choice. His hand tightens around my hair, pulling my head back. <p> Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the wall. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. His hands trail down my thighs so that my craving spirals out of control. How can he turn me on with one word?
