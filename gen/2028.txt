Crap. That look!<p> 'You. Are. So. Beautiful,' he whispers, staring intently into my eyes. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my throat, insistent, making me squirm. His eyes glowing with lust, dominating, dominating, he softly kisses my bottom lip. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. I love his choice. I squirm against him, and his fingers curl into my hair, holding me gently in place as we kiss, forcefully. <p> Without warning, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the bedpost. I groan loudly, panting, making me writhe. He kisses me, frantic, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. I inhale sharply. <p>
