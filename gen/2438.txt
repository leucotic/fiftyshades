He reaches down, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He kisses me, tasting, insistent. Dominating, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside, sparking electricity ... below. He softly kisses my cheek, and an electric thrill thrums through me. The haunting strains of Kings of Leon drift through the headphones he put on me. How unexpected. His fingers curl into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. <p> 'Face the wall.' <p> His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. My heart skips a beat. If only it didn't take a contract and a pair of handcuffs to satisfy him. <p> 'I want you so much,' he growls, staring intently into my eyes. Without warning, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the bedpost. I groan loudly, panting, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. His eyes wild, his eyes wild, his mouth is on mine. It's pleasure overload.
