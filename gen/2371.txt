'Ready?,' he breathes in my ear, warmth pooling below my waist. I glance nervously at the playroom. <p> He lifts my chin, and my breathing accelerates. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent. He kisses me, and an electric thrill thrums through me. The sultry strains of Tallis waft through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I moan again into his mouth, and he curls his fingers around my head, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, savagely. <p> He grins against my neck. If only it didn't take a contract and a flogger to satisfy him. That flogger! We've never used a flogger before. His eyes glance over the instrument, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> Moving suddenly, he pushes me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and my pulse is haywire. He softly kisses my bottom lip, and I'm drowning in a pool of desire. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me. <p>
