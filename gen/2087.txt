'Here? ,' he murmurs, his breathing husky, and tingling shoots through me as a delicious tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Please.' I swallow. <p> He smiles twistedly. 'I want to hear you moan for me.' <p> 'Surprise me,' I breathe. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, my insides liquefying. His mouth is on mine, exploring, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>, igniting a fire deep within. I can hear a song by Miley Cyrus drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss.
