Moving suddenly, he slams me against the bedpost. He's pinning me to the bedpost using his hips, and I inhale sharply. His fingertips run along my neck. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me. How does he have this power over me?<p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, igniting my blood. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, sparking electricity ... below, igniting a fire deep within. He kisses me, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I bite my lip, and he curls his fingers around my head, holding me gently in place. My subconscious is purring with pleasure.
