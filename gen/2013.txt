'You were very disobedient,' he breathes. His eyes are scorching molten gray, and tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes,' I whisper . <p> He smiles wickedly. 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you.' <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I exhale. <p> He leans in, and my heart starts pounding. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, tasting. He softly kisses my throat, dominating, making me squirm, raising uncontrollable urges in me. I yelp, and he curls his fingers around my head, holding my head in place as we kiss, forcefully. My subconscious is screaming at me.
