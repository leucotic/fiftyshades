'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he murmurs, his breathing hard, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me as my muscles clench deep inside me. <p> 'Okay.' I swallow. <p> His lips tense. 'Good.' <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I exhale. <p> Tipping my chin back, his tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting my blood. Dominating, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. He kisses me, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. I yelp, and he curls his fingers into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss, forcefully. My subconscious is purring with pleasure.
