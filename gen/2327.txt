Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my temple, exploring, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. He kisses me, tasting, making me tremble. Dominating, he softly kisses my bottom lip. I can hear a song by Justin Bieber drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. One of his hands moves into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. <p> 'Face the wall.' <p> Those nipple clamps! We've never used a pair of nipple clamps before. <i>Holy crap</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> 'You are so beautiful,' he growls as he hovers over me. Suddenly, he slams me against the desk. He restrains me with his hips, and it's pleasure overload. His mouth is on mine, and I am awash with sensation. I groan loudly, panting.
