Moving suddenly, he slams me against the bedpost. He holds me against his hips, and all the air leaves my body. He softly kisses my cheek, frantic, making me writhe. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. <p> Leaning down, he kisses me, insistent, warmth pooling below my waist. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, shallowing my breath, raising uncontrollable urges in me. His mouth is on mine, and everything in my body tightens. His tongue invades my mouth, tasting, coursing heat throughout my body, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. The sultry strains of Justin Bieber drift through the headphones he put on me. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I squirm against him, and his fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss.
