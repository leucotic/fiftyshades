All of a sudden, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the desk. I groan, frustrated, making me yearn for him, making me yearn for him. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and I'm drowning in a pool of desire. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, making my muscles clench in response. He softly kisses my bottom lip, insistent, raising uncontrollable urges in me. His eyes glowing with lust, dominating, his mouth is on mine. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and I tingle ... everywhere. He grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My inner goddess glares at me.
