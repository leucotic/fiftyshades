'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he growls teasingly, warmth pooling below my waist. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes,' I breathe . <p> 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you,' he breathes, his breathing low. <p> 'Surprise me,' I exhale. <p> He leans in, and my heart starts pounding. His tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, dominating. Insistent, tasting, he kisses me. He softly kisses my throat, dominating, raising uncontrollable urges in me. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I squirm against him, and he curls his fingers around my head, pulling my head back.
