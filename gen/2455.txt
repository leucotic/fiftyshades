'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he breathes in my ear, igniting my blood. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes,' I breathe . <p> He smiles wickedly. 'Tell me what you want.' <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I exhale. <p> He lifts my chin, and my stomach somersaults. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring. He softly kisses my temple, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. Pulling my head back, his hand tightens around my hair, fisting his hands. My subconscious is staring at me in awe.
