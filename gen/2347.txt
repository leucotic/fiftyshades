Catching me off guard, he slams me against the desk. He's pinning me to the desk using his hips, and I groan loudly, panting. His tongue invades my mouth, and I'm drowning in a pool of desire. I'm going to combust. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my throat, dominating, making me tremble. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, anticipation and anxiety charging through me, sending delicious shivers down my spine. I can hear a song by Miley Cyrus drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His hand tightens around my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss, frantically.
