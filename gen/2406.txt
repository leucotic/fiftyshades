He runs his nose along my forehead, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, insistent, insistent. He kisses me, and an electric thrill thrums through me. Exploring, tasting, his eyes glowing with lust, his mouth is on mine. The sultry strains of Tallis drift through the headphones he put on me. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I gasp and moan against his lips, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, pulling my head back. <p> 'Get on the bed.' <p> Those nipple clamps! We've never used a pair of nipple clamps before. <i>Holy shit</i>. His eyes glance over the clamps, and my muscles clench deep inside me. <p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he growls, pinning me with his bold gaze. Without warning, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the doorway. It's pleasure overload, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His fingers softly trace up my neck so that I surrender briefly to the sensation. How can he do this to me?
