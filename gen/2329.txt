Suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the wall. My heart is pounding, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. He gently trails his hands up my thighs, and desire and anxiety pump through me. How can he do this to me?<p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my throat, his eyes glowing with lust, coursing heat throughout my body. He kisses me, dominating, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. His mouth is on mine, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, making me tremble, igniting a fire deep within. I can hear music faintly. How appropriate. His fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss, forcefully.
