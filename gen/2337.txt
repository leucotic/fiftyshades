'Here? ,' he whispers in my ear, sparking electricity ... below. I glance nervously at the bed. <p> He lifts my chin, and my heart starts pounding. His tongue invades my mouth, exploring, his eyes glowing with lust. Insistent, exploring, tasting, his mouth is on mine. The sultry strains of Kings of Leon waft through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. One of his hands moves into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. <p> His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. <i>Oh, I want this</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> All of a sudden, he shoves me against the desk. He holds me against his hips, and it's pleasure overload. He runs his hands gently up my thighs so that my body rises and fills with my arousal. I flush scarlet. <i>Crap</i>. <p>
