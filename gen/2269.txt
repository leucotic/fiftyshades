Oh my. That gaze!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he whispers, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my bottom lip, dominating, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, dominating, sparking electricity ... below, making me tremble. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back. <p> Abruptly, he shoves me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and I groan, frustrated. He skims his hands across my thighs, and desire courses through my blood. How does he have this power over me?<p>
