Holy crap. That sex appeal!<p> 'Keep still,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, making me tremble. His mouth is on mine, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. I can hear a song by Justin Bieber drifting through the air. How unexpected. I squirm against him, and his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, pulling my head back as we kiss, frantically. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the doorway. I groan, frustrated, making me writhe. He softly traces his fingertips across my thighs. My pulse is haywire. I blush scarlet, ashamed and excited at the same time. <i>Oh my</i>. <p>
