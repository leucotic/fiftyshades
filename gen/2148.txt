I want him so badly. That power!<p> 'You. Are. So. Beautiful,' he growls, staring intently into my eyes. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my throat, exploring, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. He softly kisses my temple, insistent, raising uncontrollable urges in me, making me tremble. His eyes glowing with lust, his mouth is on mine. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. The haunting strains of Kings of Leon drift through the headphones he put on me. He always puts songs on repeat in here. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, he curls his fingers around my head, running his fingers through my hair. <p> Moving suddenly, he shoves me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and I'm going to combust. He traces his fingertips up my thighs softly. I groan, frustrated. How can his body do this to me?<p>
