He grins against my neck. Jeez, he's so complicated. That paddle! We've never used a paddle before. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Ready?,' he growls in my ear, raising uncontrollable urges in me. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes...' I whisper . <p> He caresses my hair, gazing at me tenderly, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, making me tremble. His eyes glowing with lust, insistent, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. The sensual strains of Kings of Leon waft through the air. How unexpected. His fingers curl into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the bedpost. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. His mouth is on mine, exploring, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. All the air leaves my body.
