'Do you want to play? ,' he breathes, his voice harsh, and an electric thrill thrums through me as an electric thrill thrums through me. <p> 'Please...' I breathe . <p> His lips twitch. 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you.' <p> 'Take me,' I exhale. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my throat, dominating, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, anticipation and anxiety charging through me, coursing heat throughout my body. Insistent, his mouth is on mine. I moan, and his hand tightens around my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss. My subconscious is purring with pleasure.
