That flogger! We've never used a flogger before. My stomach somersaults. Boy, he's so fucked-up. <p> 'You were very disobedient,' he growls. His gaze is gray, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. <p> 'Okay...' I breathe . <p> 'Good girl. Good.' He caresses my cheek, gazing at me lovingly, sending delicious shivers down my spine. <p> Leaning down, his tongue invades my mouth, exploring, my insides liquefying. He kisses me, and I tingle ... everywhere. Tasting, his eyes glowing with lust, his mouth is on mine. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, raising uncontrollable urges in me, igniting a fire deep within. I bite my lip, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding me firmly in place as we kiss. My subconscious glares at me. <p> Abruptly, he slams me against the desk. He's pinning me to the desk using his hips, and all the air leaves my body. He softly kisses my bottom lip, lustful, making me yearn for him. My pulse is haywire.
