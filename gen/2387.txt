Holy crap. That power!<p> 'I want you so much,' he breathes as he hovers over me. <p> He lifts my chin, and my stomach somersaults. He softly kisses my bottom lip, insistent. Exploring, dominating, insistent, his mouth is on mine. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, coursing heat throughout my body, raising uncontrollable urges in me. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. How appropriate. Pulling my head back, he curls his fingers around my head, fisting his hands. <p> All of a sudden, he pushes me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and I practically convulse. He kisses me, and I lose myself to his fervent passion. I groan loudly, panting. <p>
