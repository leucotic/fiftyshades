Holy hell. That sex appeal!<p> 'God, I need you,' he murmurs, staring intently into my eyes. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, exploring, making my muscles clench in response. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, anticipation and anxiety charging through me, coursing heat throughout my body. I bite my lip, and he curls his fingers into my hair, holding me gently in place as we kiss, savagely. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance. <p> Abruptly, he pushes me against the bedpost. He restrains me with his hips, and my breathing is too loud. He runs his fingers along my belly gently, and I am all sensation. How can his body do this to me?<p>
