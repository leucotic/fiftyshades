His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and I surrender briefly to the sensation. My pulse is haywire. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my cheek, his eyes glowing with lust, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. Dominating, insistent, he kisses me. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and everything in my body tightens. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, raising uncontrollable urges in me, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. I can hear music faintly. How appropriate. He curls his fingers into my hair, holding me firmly in place.
