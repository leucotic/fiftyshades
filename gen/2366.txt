'This is not going to hurt. It will be intense.' <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I breathe. <p> He lifts my chin, and my breath hitches. He softly kisses my temple, insistent. He kisses me, exploring, igniting my blood. His eyes glowing with lust, insistent, dominating, his tongue invades my mouth. Pulling my head back, his fingers curl into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My inner goddess glares at me.
