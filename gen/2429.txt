Moving suddenly, he pushes me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and my breathing is too loud. Forceful, his eyes wild, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. My pulse is haywire. <p> Leaning down, he kisses me, dominating, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, warmth pooling below my waist, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. His tongue invades my mouth, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. He kisses me, dominating, my insides liquefying, sparking electricity ... below. He grabs my hair and yanks down, pulling my head back. My inner goddess swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head.
