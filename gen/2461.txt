That flogger! We've never used a flogger before. I glance nervously at the doorway. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'Ready?,' he growls, his voice low, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously as everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He caresses my hair, gazing at me lovingly, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my bottom lip, exploring, making me squirm. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and I tingle ... everywhere. Insistent, exploring, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. He kisses me, tasting, sending delicious shivers down my spine. I can hear a song by Miley Cyrus drifting through the air. How appropriate. His fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place. <p> All of a sudden, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the desk. All the air leaves my body, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. He runs his fingertips down my body, and desire and anxiety pump through me. How does he have this power over me?
