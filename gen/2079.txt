'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he whispers. His breathing is hard, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I glance nervously at the playroom. <p> He lifts my chin, and my heart skips a beat. He kisses me, insistent. His mouth is on mine, and an electric thrill thrums through me. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting a fire deep within. Exploring, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, he grabs my hair and yanks down, fisting his hands. My inner goddess is purring with pleasure. <p> He straightens. My mouth goes dry. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the wall. My breathing is too loud, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His fingertips gently run down my body, and my body rises and fills with my arousal. How can his body do this to me?<p>
