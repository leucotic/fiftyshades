All of a sudden, he slams me against the desk. He restrains me with his hips, and it's so hot. He softly kisses my bottom lip, and my craving spirals out of control. It's so hot. <p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and my heart skips a beat. His mouth is on mine, insistent. He kisses me, tasting, sparking electricity ... below. His tongue invades my mouth, and everything in my body tightens. He softly kisses my cheek, insistent, making my muscles clench in response, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. I moan again against his lips, and he curls his fingers into my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss. My subconscious is thrilled.
