'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he growls, his eyes gray, and I tingle ... everywhere as an electric thrill thrums through me. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> He reaches down, and my stomach somersaults. He kisses me, exploring. Exploring, dominating, his tongue invades my mouth. His mouth is on mine, insistent, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I moan again into his mouth, and his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding my head in place. <p> His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. My heart skips a beat. I'm suddenly flooded with despair. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> All of a sudden, he pushes me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and it's so hot. His eyes wild, exploring, he kisses me. I'm going to combust. <p>
