Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, insistent, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. Holding my head in place as we kiss, forcefully, he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding tight. My subconscious glares at me. <p> 'Face the wall,' he whispers, and I comply immediately. <p> His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. <i>Holy hell</i>. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'You are so beautiful,' he murmurs, staring intently into my eyes. Suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the desk. I groan, frustrated, making me yearn for him. His tongue invades my mouth, lustful, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. I'm going to combust.
