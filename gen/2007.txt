His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. My heart starts pounding. My mouth goes dry. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> 'Ready?,' he breathes in my ear, raising uncontrollable urges in me. <p> 'Yes.' I swallow. <p> His lips tense. 'Tell me what you want.' He caresses my cheek, gazing at me lovingly, igniting my blood. <p> Leaning down, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, dominating, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, making me squirm, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He kisses me, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. Holding me firmly in place, he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding tight. My inner goddess is staring at me in awe. <p> Suddenly, he pushes me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and it's so hot. He traces his hands gently up my back so that desire seizes me with a vengeance. I flush deeply. <i>Holy shit</i>.
