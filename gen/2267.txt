His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. I glance nervously at the bed. My mouth goes dry. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> 'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he growls, his voice low, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously as tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Yes.' I swallow. <p> He caresses my cheek, gazing at me lovingly, making me squirm. <p> He lifts my chin, and my heart skips a beat. He kisses me, insistent. He softly kisses my temple, and I tingle ... everywhere. I squirm against him, and he curls his fingers into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. My inner goddess does the samba. <p> Without warning, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the wall. I inhale sharply, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. His fingertips trail up my neck, and my body rises and fills with my arousal. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Holy shit</i>.
