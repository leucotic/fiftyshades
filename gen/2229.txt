All of a sudden, he shoves me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and I inhale sharply. Exploring, his tongue invades my mouth. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, igniting my blood. His mouth is on mine, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. He kisses me, insistent, shallowing my breath, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I squirm against him, and he curls his fingers around my head, lifting his other hand to cradle my face.
