All of a sudden, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the wall. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, making me yearn for him. He trails his hands down my body. All the air leaves my body. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Shit</i>. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my temple, insistent, making me tremble. Dominating, his eyes glowing with lust, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. He kisses me, exploring, sparking electricity ... below. I bite my lip, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding me firmly in place as we kiss. My subconscious has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly.
