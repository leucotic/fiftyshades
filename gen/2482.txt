'Do you want me? ,' he breathes. His eyes are burning brighter, and my muscles clench deep inside me. I glance nervously at the bed. <p> Tipping my chin back, his tongue invades my mouth, dominating, making me squirm. His eyes glowing with lust, his mouth is on mine. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, warmth pooling below my waist, making my muscles clench in response. Dominating, exploring, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. I yelp, and one of his hands moves into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss, savagely. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. <i>Crap</i>. His eyes glance over the cuffs, and tingling shoots through me. <p> Suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the desk. I groan, frustrated, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. Lustful, forceful, he kisses me. It's pleasure overload. <p>
