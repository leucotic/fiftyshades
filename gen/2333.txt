Oh, I want this. That gaze!<p> 'God, I need you,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. <p> Leaning down, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, dominating, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. His eyes glowing with lust, exploring, dominating, he kisses me. He softly kisses my throat, exploring, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. His tongue invades my mouth, and everything in my body tightens. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding me gently in place. <p> Suddenly, he pushes me against the wall. He restrains me with his hips, and it's so eroticâ€”his need for me. His hands trail across my back softly, and my craving spirals out of control. How does he have this power over me?<p>
