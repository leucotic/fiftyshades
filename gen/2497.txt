Crap. That look!<p> 'I want you so much,' he whispers, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, making me squirm. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, my insides liquefying. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, one of his hands moves into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious is thrilled. <p> All of a sudden, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the bedpost. All the air leaves my body, making me writhe. His fingers skim up my belly. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. How can his body do this to me?<p>
