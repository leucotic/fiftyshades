Without warning, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the bedpost. I groan, frustrated, making me yearn for him. His fingertips skim up my body gently so that I surrender briefly to the sensation. How does he have this power over me?<p> He lifts my chin, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. His tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, tasting. Insistent, tasting, dominating, his mouth is on mine. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. I yelp, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place. My inner goddess glares at me.
