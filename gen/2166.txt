Abruptly, he pushes me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and it's pleasure overload. He kisses me, and desire courses through my blood. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me. <p> Leaning down, his tongue invades my mouth, dominating, coursing heat throughout my body. His eyes glowing with lust, his mouth is on mine. He softly kisses my temple, tasting, igniting a fire deep within. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, his fingers curl into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious glares at me.
