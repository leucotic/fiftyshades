He runs his nose along my forehead, and I'm quaking like a leaf. His mouth is on mine, insistent, insistent. Dominating, tasting, exploring, his mouth is on mine. His tongue invades my mouth, and tingling shoots through me. Dominating, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. I can hear a song by Miley Cyrus drifting through the air. I love his choice. He curls his fingers into my hair, holding me gently in place. <p> 'Face the wall.' <p> His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. <i>Holy hell</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he whispers as he hovers over me. Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the desk. I'm going to combust, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He traces his fingers softly down my body so that I am all sensation. How can his body do this to me?
