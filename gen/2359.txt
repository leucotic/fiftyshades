Holy shit. That gaze!<p> 'God, I need you,' he whispers, staring intently into my eyes. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my breathing accelerates. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, tasting, insistent. He softly kisses my face, and my muscles clench deep inside me. The sultry strains of Miley Cyrus waft through the air. I love his choice. I squirm against him, and his hand tightens around my hair, holding me firmly in place. <p> Suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the bedpost. All the air leaves my body, making me writhe, making me writhe. He gently traces his fingertips across my belly. It's so hot. How can his body do this to me?<p>
