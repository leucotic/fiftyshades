'Here? ,' he whispers in my ear, sending delicious shivers down my spine. I tremble anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, sparking electricity ... below. His tongue invades my mouth, and everything in my body tightens. Tasting, insistent, dominating, he softly kisses my temple. The haunting strains of Miley Cyrus drift through the headphones he put on me. I love his choice. I yelp, and his hand tightens around my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. <p> His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. <i>Holy crap</i>. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> Suddenly, he slams me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and I inhale sharply. His hands trail along my belly so that desire seizes me with a vengeance. How can he do this to me?<p>
