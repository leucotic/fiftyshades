'Here? ,' he breathes, his voice husky, and everything in my body tightens as dark desire unfolds throughout my body. I glance nervously at the bed. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my cheek, exploring, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. His eyes glowing with lust, dominating, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. His fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> He straightens. God, he's so fucked-up. His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Without warning, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the wall. My heart is pounding, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He softly runs his fingers up my back so that desire seizes me with a vengeance. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Shit</i>. <p>
