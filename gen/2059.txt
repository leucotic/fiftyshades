All of a sudden, he pushes me against the bedpost. He's pinning me to the bedpost using his hips, and fuck, I'm panting already. His fingertips gently trace along my back. My heart is pounding. How can he turn me on with one word?<p> Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, tasting, making me squirm. He kisses me, exploring, shallowing my breath, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, making my muscles clench in response. His hand tightens around my hair, holding my head in place. My subconscious is purring with pleasure.
