'Here? ,' he breathes, his eyes stormy, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously as tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes,' I exhale . <p> His lips twitch. 'Tell me what you want.' <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I whisper. <p> He reaches down, and my stomach somersaults. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, tasting, dominating. Exploring, insistent, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. He kisses me, insistent, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, coursing heat throughout my body. Holding me gently in place as we kiss, frantically, he curls his fingers around my head, holding tight. My subconscious does the samba.
