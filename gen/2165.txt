His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. If only it didn't take a contract and a leather strap to satisfy him. <p> 'Do you want me? ,' he growls in my ear, making me tremble. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'Good. Tell me what you want.' He caresses my cheek, gazing at me tenderly, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, tasting, my insides liquefying. He softly kisses my throat, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I moan, and he curls his fingers into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, savagely. My inner goddess is staring at me in awe. <p> Without warning, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the doorway. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me yearn for him, making me yearn for him. His fingers trail along my body gently so that I'm drowning in a pool of desire. I blush from my head to my toes. <i>Shit</i>.
