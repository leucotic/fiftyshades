'Do you want me? ,' he murmurs, his breathing husky, and an electric thrill thrums through me as desire unfurls deep in my belly. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> He reaches down, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. He kisses me, exploring. Insistent, dominating, tasting, his tongue invades my mouth. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding my head in place. My subconscious is thrilled. <p> His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. <i>I want him so badly</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> Moving suddenly, he pushes me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and my heart is pounding. His hands trail up my thighs so that I surrender briefly to the sensation. I blush from my head to my toes. <i>Holy shit</i>. <p>
