That paddle! We've never used a paddle before. <i>Oh my</i>. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he breathes. His gaze is softly luminous in the diffuse glow of the lamp, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. <p> 'Yes,' I whisper . <p> His fingers brush my face gently, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, exploring, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. His mouth is on mine, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, his fingers curl into my hair, fisting his hands. My subconscious is screaming at me. <p> Moving suddenly, he slams me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and my breathing is too loud. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and my body rises and fills with my arousal. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me.
