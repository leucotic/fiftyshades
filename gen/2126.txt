Catching me off guard, he shoves me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and I inhale sharply. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, frantic, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. All the air leaves my body. <p> He lifts my chin, and I'm quaking like a leaf. His mouth is on mine, dominating, insistent. He kisses me, tasting, sparking electricity ... below. He curls his fingers around my head, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, frantically. My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves.
