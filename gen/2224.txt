Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the doorway. I groan, frustrated, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His fingers skim up my neck. My pulse is haywire. How can he do this to me?<p> Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, tasting, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. He softly kisses my throat, exploring, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>, igniting my blood. Holding my head in place, he grabs my hair and yanks down, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious is staring at me in awe.
