Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the desk. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. His hands run up my back. My breathing is too loud. I blush scarlet. <i>Holy shit</i>. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, tasting, coursing heat throughout my body. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, my insides liquefying. Tasting, insistent, exploring, his mouth is on mine. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, warmth pooling below my waist. I gasp at his words , and one of his hands moves into my hair, holding me firmly in place. My subconscious is thrilled.
