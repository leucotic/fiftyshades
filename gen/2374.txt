I want him so badly. That look!<p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he murmurs, staring intently into my eyes. <p> He lifts my chin, and my heart skips a beat. He kisses me, exploring, dominating. Insistent, his eyes glowing with lust, he softly kisses my face. I can hear a song by Miley Cyrus drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. Holding me firmly in place, he curls his fingers around my head, running his fingers through my hair. <p> Suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the bedpost. All the air leaves my body, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. His hands trail down my body softly, and I lose myself to his fervent passion. I flush , feeling my face flame. <i>Holy crap</i>. <p>
