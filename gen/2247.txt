Suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the bedpost. It's so hot, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He skims his fingertips up my neck. My pulse is haywire. I blush , feeling my face flame. <i>Oh, I want this</i>. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, sparking electricity ... below. Tasting, dominating, his mouth is on mine. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. His fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss, forcefully. My subconscious is staring at me in awe.
