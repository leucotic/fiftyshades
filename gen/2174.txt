'Do you want to play? ,' he breathes, his voice harsh, and everything in my body tightens as an electric thrill thrums through me. I glance anxiously at the bed. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, warmth pooling below my waist. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. I can hear a song by Kings of Leon drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. He curls his fingers into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. <p> His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. <i>Oh, I want this</i>. His fingers brush the strap, and I tingle ... everywhere. <p> Without warning, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the desk. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. He trails his hands down my belly softly, and desire courses through my blood. I blush from my head to my toes. <i>Crap</i>. <p>
