Shit. That sex appeal!<p> 'I want you so much,' he breathes, staring intently into my eyes. <p> He lifts my chin, and my heart skips a beat. He softly kisses my face, insistent. Dominating, exploring, he kisses me. I can hear a song by Justin Bieber drifting through the air. How unexpected. I squirm against him, and his fingers curl into my hair, holding me gently in place. <p> Abruptly, he shoves me against the bedpost. He holds me against his hips, and all the air leaves my body. He trails his fingertips up my body so that my craving spirals out of control. I blush , feeling my face flame. <i>Crap</i>. <p>
