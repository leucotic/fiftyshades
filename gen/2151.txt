Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, making me tremble. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, my insides liquefying. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, raising uncontrollable urges in me, warmth pooling below my waist. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. <p> 'On your knees.' <p> He stalks gracefully forward. Boy, he's so hard to please. His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he whispers, staring intently into my eyes. Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the desk. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, making me writhe. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, forceful, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. I'm going to combust.
