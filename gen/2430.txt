I blush scarlet. <i>I want him so badly</i>. <p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and my breathing accelerates. He kisses me, insistent, his eyes glowing with lust, dominating. Tasting, he softly kisses my face. I bite my lip, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, pulling my head back. My subconscious is thrilled.
