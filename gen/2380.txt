That paddle! We've never used a paddle before. <i>Shit</i>. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he breathes, his eyes darkening, and I tingle ... everywhere as an electric thrill thrums through me. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'This is not going to hurt. It will be intense. This will be hard, but I won't hurt you.' He caresses my hair, gazing at me tenderly, coursing heat throughout my body. <p> Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, dominating, igniting my blood. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside, making me squirm. Tasting, his eyes glowing with lust, dominating, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. His mouth is on mine, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I can hear a song by Miley Cyrus drifting through the air. How unexpected. He curls his fingers into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the bedpost. I groan loudly, panting, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. His hands skim across my body gently so that I surrender briefly to the sensation. How can his body do this to me?
