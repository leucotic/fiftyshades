Shit. That sex appeal!<p> 'I want you so much,' he growls, staring intently into my eyes. <p> He reaches down, and my heart starts pounding. He kisses me, insistent. He softly kisses my throat, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. Dominating, exploring, his eyes glowing with lust, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. His tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, making my muscles clench in response, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. I can hear music faintly. How unexpected. I gasp at his words , and his fingers curl into my hair, holding me firmly in place. <p> Moving suddenly, he slams me against the desk. He holds me against his hips, and my heart is pounding. He softly kisses my temple, forceful, making me writhe. All the air leaves my body. <p>
