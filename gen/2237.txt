He kisses me, insistent, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. Dominating, exploring, his tongue invades my mouth. I can hear a song by Kings of Leon drifting through the air. I love his choice. I moan again , and his hand tightens around my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss, frantically. <p> Suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the wall. I groan, frustrated, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. His fingertips run up my thighs so that desire and anxiety pump through me. How can his body do this to me?<p>
