Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, insistent, sparking electricity ... below. Exploring, his mouth is on mine. He softly kisses my face, exploring, raising uncontrollable urges in me. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, warmth pooling below my waist, shallowing my breath. I can hear music faintly. How appropriate. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding me firmly in place as we kiss, savagely. <p> 'On your knees.' <p> That leather strap! We've never used a leather strap before. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'I want you so much,' he murmurs, staring intently into my eyes. Abruptly, he slams me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and it's so hot. He kisses me, frantic, making me writhe. It's pleasure overload.
