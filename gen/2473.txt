He softly kisses my temple, exploring, coursing heat throughout my body. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, anticipation and anxiety charging through me, igniting a fire deep within. The haunting strains of Tallis drift through the headphones he put on me. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His fingers curl into my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss.
