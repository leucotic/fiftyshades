That flogger! We've never used a flogger before. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. If only it didn't take a contract and a flogger to satisfy him. <p> 'Ready?,' he breathes. His voice is low, and my muscles clench deep inside me. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' I swallow. <p> He cups my face gently, warmth pooling below my waist. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my throat, tasting, shallowing my breath. He kisses me, exploring, warmth pooling below my waist, igniting my blood. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, savagely, his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, fisting his hands. My subconscious has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly. <p> Without warning, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the doorway. I practically convulse, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. He traces his fingers softly up my body, and desire courses through my blood. How can he do this to me?
