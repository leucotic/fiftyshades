Suddenly, he slams me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and I groan, frustrated. His eyes wild, exploring, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. I inhale sharply. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. He kisses me, and everything in my body tightens. Holding my head in place as we kiss, forcefully, his hand tightens around my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance.
