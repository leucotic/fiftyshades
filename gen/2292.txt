'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he murmurs. His gaze is darkest slate, and everything in my body tightens. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> He leans in, and my heart skips a beat. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, dominating, his eyes glowing with lust. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. His tongue invades my mouth, and I tingle ... everywhere. I can hear a song by Kings of Leon drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. One of his hands moves into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss, frantically. <p> His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. <i>Holy crap</i>. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> All of a sudden, he slams me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and fuck, I'm panting already. He kisses me, and my craving spirals out of control. I groan loudly, panting. <p>
