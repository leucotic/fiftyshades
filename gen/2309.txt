'You were very disobedient,' he growls teasingly, shallowing my breath. I shiver anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, exploring, warmth pooling below my waist. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and everything in my body tightens. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. How unexpected. I gasp at his words , and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding me firmly in place. <p> That flogger! We've never used a flogger before. <i>Oh my</i>. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Abruptly, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the desk. I groan loudly, panting, making me writhe. He kisses me, forceful, making me yearn for him, making me yearn for him. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me. <p>
