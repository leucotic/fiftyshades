Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the bedpost. My breathing is too loud, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, forceful, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, dominating, sending delicious shivers down my spine. He kisses me, and I tingle ... everywhere. I yelp, and he curls his fingers around my head, pulling my head back. My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves.
