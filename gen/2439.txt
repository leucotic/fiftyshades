All of a sudden, he pushes me against the bedpost. He's pinning me to the bedpost using his hips, and it's so hot. His hands softly trail up my back so that my craving spirals out of control. How can he turn me on with one word?<p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, raising uncontrollable urges in me. His mouth is on mine, tasting, coursing heat throughout my body, my insides liquefying. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and an electric thrill thrums through me. I squirm against him, and he curls his fingers into my hair, pulling my head back. My inner goddess does a slow erotic dance.
