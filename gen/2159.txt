'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he murmurs, his gaze darkening, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously as I tingle ... everywhere. I tremble anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> Tipping my chin back, his tongue invades my mouth, insistent, raising uncontrollable urges in me. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, shallowing my breath. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding my head in place as we kiss. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance. <p> His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. If only it didn't take a contract and a paddle to satisfy him. <p> Moving suddenly, he pushes me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and it's pleasure overload. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and I surrender briefly to the sensation. I practically convulse. <p>
