What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'You are so beautiful,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. Abruptly, he pushes me against the bedpost. He holds me against his hips, and all the air leaves my body. His tongue invades my mouth, frantic, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. My breathing is too loud.
