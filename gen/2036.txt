Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the wall. I practically convulse, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. Lustful, his mouth is on mine. I groan, frustrated. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, making me tremble. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and I tingle ... everywhere. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding me firmly in place. My subconscious is screaming at me.
