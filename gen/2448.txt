Holy cow. That sex appeal!<p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he whispers as he hovers over me. <p> Leaning down, he kisses me, insistent, making me tremble. Exploring, tasting, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, sparking electricity ... below, my insides liquefying. He kisses me, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. How appropriate. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, his fingers curl into my hair, holding tight. <p> Without warning, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the bedpost. All the air leaves my body, making me writhe, making me writhe. He trails his fingertips along my belly gently so that I lose myself to his fervent passion. How can his body do this to me?<p>
