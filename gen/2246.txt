His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I glance nervously at the bed. His fingers brush the instrument, and an electric thrill thrums through me. <p> 'You were very disobedient,' he murmurs. His gaze is intense, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He caresses my cheek, gazing at me tenderly, making me tremble. <p> He reaches down, and my breath hitches. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, tasting. His mouth is on mine, insistent, sparking electricity ... below, making my muscles clench in response. Dominating, his eyes glowing with lust, exploring, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, savagely, he curls his fingers into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> Abruptly, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the doorway. My pulse is haywire, making me yearn for him. He traces his hands up my body gently, and I am awash with sensation. How can he turn me on with one word?
