Holy shit. That gaze!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he murmurs, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, shallowing my breath. His eyes glowing with lust, insistent, tasting, his tongue invades my mouth. He softly kisses my face, and tingling shoots through me. Pulling my head back, his fingers curl into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious is purring with pleasure. <p> Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the bedpost. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me yearn for him. His hands softly trail up my body so that I lose myself to his fervent passion. How can his body do this to me?<p>
