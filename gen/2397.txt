His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. His fingers brush the paddle, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Ready?,' he growls, his voice husky, and I tingle ... everywhere as everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. <p> 'Please,' I breathe . <p> He smiles twistedly. 'Good girl.' He caresses my hair, gazing at me tenderly, shallowing my breath. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, igniting a fire deep within. He kisses me, exploring, warmth pooling below my waist, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, dominating, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>, making me squirm. He curls his fingers into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss, frantically. My subconscious is screaming at me. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the doorway. I'm going to combust, making me yearn for him. Forceful, his mouth is on mine. My breathing is too loud.
