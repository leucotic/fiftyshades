'Do you want me? ,' he murmurs teasingly, making me squirm. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. His tongue invades my mouth, tasting, making me squirm, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. He curls his fingers into my hair, pulling my head back. My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. I tremble anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Suddenly, he pushes me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and it's so hot. His fingertips trail down my back gently so that I lose myself to his fervent passion. How can his body do this to me?<p>
