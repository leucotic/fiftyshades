Without warning, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the wall. My breathing is too loud, making me writhe, making me writhe. His mouth is on mine, and my body rises and fills with my arousal. My pulse is haywire. <p> Tipping my chin back, his tongue invades my mouth, dominating, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, sending delicious shivers down my spine, shallowing my breath. He kisses me, and tingling shoots through me. Insistent, tasting, he kisses me. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His hand tightens around my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, forcefully.
