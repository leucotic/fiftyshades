'Here? ,' he breathes, his breathing harsh, and everything in my body tightens as a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> 'Please.' I swallow. <p> 'This is not going to hurt. It will be intense,' he growls, his eyes stormy. <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I whisper. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, making me squirm. Dominating, he softly kisses my bottom lip. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding me firmly in place as we kiss. My subconscious is purring with pleasure.
