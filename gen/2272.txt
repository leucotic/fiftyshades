Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, making me squirm. His mouth is on mine, exploring, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. I love his choice. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding my head in place as we kiss. <p> 'On your knees.' <p> He grins against my neck. My mouth goes dry. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Keep still,' he murmurs, pinning me with his bold gaze. Moving suddenly, he pushes me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. He runs his fingers across my body gently so that my body rises and fills with my arousal. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Holy shit</i>.
