He leans in, and my breath hitches. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, insistent, tasting. Dominating, exploring, insistent, he softly kisses my bottom lip. He kisses me, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, one of his hands moves into my hair, holding tight. <p> 'On your knees.' <p> His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. My breathing accelerates. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> 'I want you so much,' he breathes as he hovers over me. Abruptly, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the wall. I groan loudly, panting, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. His fingers gently skim down my body, and I surrender briefly to the sensation. I blush scarlet, ashamed and turned on at the same time. <i>Shit</i>.
