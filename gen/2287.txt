Holy hell. That look!<p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he murmurs, staring intently into my eyes. <p> He leans in, and my breath hitches. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, his eyes glowing with lust, his eyes glowing with lust. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I squirm against him, and one of his hands moves into my hair, holding me gently in place as we kiss, forcefully. My inner goddess is purring with pleasure. <p> Abruptly, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the bedpost. All the air leaves my body, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. He kisses me, exploring, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. I practically convulse. <p>
