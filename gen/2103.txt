'Do you want to play? ,' he growls. His eyes are intense, and everything in my body tightens. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> He lifts my chin, and my stomach somersaults. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent. He softly kisses my throat, and I tingle ... everywhere. Dominating, exploring, he kisses me. His tongue invades my mouth, insistent, igniting a fire deep within. The haunting strains of Kings of Leon waft through the air. I love his choice. Pulling my head back as we kiss, his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, running his fingers through my hair. <p> He grins against my neck. If only it didn't take a contract and a flogger to please him. His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Abruptly, he shoves me against the desk. He holds me against his hips, and I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, lustful, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me. <p>
