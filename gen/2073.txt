He straightens. If only it didn't take a contract and a pair of nipple clamps to satisfy him. His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'Do you want to play? ,' he breathes. His gaze is scorching molten gray, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes,' I breathe . <p> He touches my face gently, igniting a fire deep within. <p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and my heart starts pounding. He kisses me, insistent, exploring, his eyes glowing with lust. His mouth is on mine, and an electric thrill thrums through me. He softly kisses my face, tasting, making me tremble. He softly kisses my cheek, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. I bite my lip, and he curls his fingers around my head, holding me gently in place as we kiss, frantically. My inner goddess glares at me. <p> All of a sudden, he slams me against the bedpost. He holds me against his hips, and I groan loudly, panting. He skims his fingertips down my belly softly. I'm going to combust. How can he turn me on with one word?
