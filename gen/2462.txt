Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, making me tremble. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and an electric thrill thrums through me. His mouth is on mine, insistent, sparking electricity ... below, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He softly kisses my throat, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. I yelp, and he curls his fingers around my head, holding me gently in place. My subconscious glares at me. <p> 'Turn around,' he murmurs, making me squirm and making my muscles clench in response. <p> His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. My breathing accelerates. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Keep still,' he breathes as he hovers over me. Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the desk. All the air leaves my body, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. His hands gently run along my belly. I groan, frustrated. How can he do this to me?
