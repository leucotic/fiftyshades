'Ready?,' he whispers, his voice husky, and my muscles clench deep inside me as desire unfurls deep in my belly. I glance anxiously at the playroom. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, tasting, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. He kisses me, and I tingle ... everywhere. He softly kisses my throat, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting a fire deep within, coursing heat throughout my body. Pulling my head back, his fingers curl into my hair, holding tight. My subconscious does the samba. <p> His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. I glance nervously at the bed. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the bedpost. My breathing is too loud, making me writhe. His hands trail up my thighs. It's so hot. How can his body do this to me?<p>
