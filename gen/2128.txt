He grins against my neck. God, he's so fucked-up. His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'You were very disobedient,' he whispers. His breathing is low, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'This is not going to hurt. It will be intense,' he murmurs, his breathing hard. His fingers brush my face gently, raising uncontrollable urges in me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my cheek, exploring, making me tremble. His tongue invades my mouth, insistent, warmth pooling below my waist, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, he grabs my hair and yanks down, running his fingers through my hair. <p> Without warning, he shoves me against the bedpost. He holds me against his hips, and I inhale sharply. Exploring, exploring, his mouth is on mine. It's pleasure overload.
