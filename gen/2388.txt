Crap. That sex appeal!<p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he breathes, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, making my muscles clench in response. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. He kisses me, dominating, my insides liquefying. The haunting strains of Miley Cyrus waft through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I moan into his mouth, and he curls his fingers into my hair, holding me firmly in place. <p> Suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the wall. I groan, frustrated, making me yearn for him. He traces his hands along my back softly. My breathing is too loud. I flush , feeling my face flame, ashamed and turned on at the same time. <i>Holy shit</i>. <p>
