'Ready?,' he growls. His eyes are scorching, smoky, and everything in my body tightens. I tremble anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, dominating, shallowing my breath. He kisses me, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. He grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. <p> His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. If only it didn't take a contract and a leather strap to please him. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the wall. All the air leaves my body, making me writhe. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and I'm drowning in a pool of desire. I'm going to combust. <p>
