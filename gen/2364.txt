Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. I glance nervously at the bed. My mouth goes dry. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> 'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he whispers, his voice hard, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me as my muscles clench deep inside me. <p> 'Yes.' I swallow. <p> He smirks. 'Tell me what you want.' He caresses my cheek, gazing at me tenderly, making me tremble. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my heart skips a beat. His mouth is on mine, dominating. Exploring, his tongue invades my mouth. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. He grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. My inner goddess does a slow erotic dance. <p> All of a sudden, he shoves me against the bedpost. He's pinning me to the bedpost using his hips, and I inhale sharply. He softly kisses my bottom lip, frantic, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing.
