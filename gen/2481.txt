Holy shit. That sex appeal!<p> 'I want you so much,' he growls as he hovers over me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting a fire deep within. Dominating, his mouth is on mine. His fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> Without warning, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the doorway. I groan loudly, panting, making me yearn for him. He skims his hands along my neck gently so that my body rises and fills with my arousal. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Holy cow</i>. <p>
