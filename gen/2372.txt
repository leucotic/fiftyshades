Holy cow. That look!<p> 'I want you so much,' he growls, staring intently into my eyes. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my bottom lip, his eyes glowing with lust, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. Insistent, exploring, he kisses me. His mouth is on mine, dominating, igniting my blood. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding me gently in place as we kiss. My subconscious is staring at me in awe. <p> Catching me off guard, he pushes me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and it's so eroticâ€”his need for me. He runs his fingertips up my neck. Fuck, I'm panting already. How can he do this to me?<p>
