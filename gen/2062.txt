He straightens. Boy, he's so fucked-up. Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> 'Here? ,' he breathes, his breathing harsh, and tingling shoots through me as my muscles clench deep inside me. <p> 'Okay.' I swallow. <p> He caresses my hair, gazing at me lovingly, warmth pooling below my waist. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, exploring, warmth pooling below my waist. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding my head in place. My subconscious is thrilled. <p> All of a sudden, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the wall. I groan, frustrated, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He softly runs his fingertips up my thighs, and I am awash with sensation. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Holy hell</i>.
