'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he breathes. His breathing is husky, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I glance anxiously at the doorway. <p> He leans in, and my stomach somersaults. His tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>, shallowing my breath. Insistent, dominating, tasting, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, savagely, his fingers curl into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious does the samba. <p> His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. I'm quaking like a leaf. His eyes glance over the clamps, and I tingle ... everywhere. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the wall. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me yearn for him. He runs his fingers down my body so that I surrender briefly to the sensation. How does he have this power over me?<p>
