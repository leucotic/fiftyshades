Catching me off guard, he shoves me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and it's so hot. His hands trail up my back softly so that my body rises and fills with my arousal. How can he turn me on with one word?<p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, dominating, warmth pooling below my waist. He softly kisses my face, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, making me tremble. Tasting, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I moan again into his mouth, and one of his hands moves into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss.
