Oh my. That look!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he murmurs, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my bottom lip, tasting, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, igniting a fire deep within. His eyes glowing with lust, he kisses me. His fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back. My subconscious has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly. <p> Suddenly, he pushes me against the desk. He's pinning me to the desk using his hips, and my pulse is haywire. He runs his hands gently along my neck. I inhale sharply. I flush scarlet, humiliated and excited at the same time. <i>Crap</i>. <p>
