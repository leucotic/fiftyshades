That flogger! We've never used a flogger before. <i>Crap</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'Do you want to play? ,' he murmurs. His breathing is low, and an electric thrill thrums through me. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He touches my face gently, my insides liquefying. <p> He leans in, and my stomach somersaults. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, insistent, insistent. Dominating, his eyes glowing with lust, he kisses me. He softly kisses my throat, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, igniting my blood, warmth pooling below my waist. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. Holding me firmly in place, he grabs my hair and yanks down, fisting his hands. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the doorway. My pulse is haywire, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. His eyes wild, frantic, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. Fuck, I'm panting already.
