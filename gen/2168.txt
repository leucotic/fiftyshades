Moving suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the desk. My pulse is haywire, making me yearn for him. He kisses me, and desire seizes me with a vengeance. Fuck, I'm panting already. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, dominating, shallowing my breath. He kisses me, and an electric thrill thrums through me. I can hear a song by Kings of Leon drifting through the air. I love his choice. I bite my lip, and his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding my head in place.
