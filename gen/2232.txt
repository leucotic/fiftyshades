He lifts my chin, and my breathing accelerates. He softly kisses my cheek, his eyes glowing with lust. He kisses me, and everything in my body tightens. I squirm against him, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, frantically. My inner goddess swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> 'Turn around.' <p> Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. <i>Oh, I want this</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he breathes as he hovers over me. Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the wall. I inhale sharply, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. His hands trail across my body so that desire courses through my blood. I flush , feeling my face flame. <i>Holy hell</i>.
