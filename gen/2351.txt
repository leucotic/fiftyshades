His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. <i>Crap</i>. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he whispers in my ear, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes...' I exhale . <p> He smiles wickedly. 'Good girl.' He cups my face gently, my insides liquefying. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, tasting, coursing heat throughout my body. He softly kisses my throat, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. I gasp and moan , and he curls his fingers into my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss. My subconscious glares at me. <p> Catching me off guard, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the bedpost. Fuck, I'm panting already, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. His mouth is on mine, his eyes wild, making me yearn for him. My pulse is haywire.
