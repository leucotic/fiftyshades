'You were very disobedient,' he murmurs. His voice is hard, and I tingle ... everywhere. I glance nervously at the playroom. <p> Tipping my chin back, his tongue invades my mouth, exploring, making me tremble. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and everything in my body tightens. Holding me gently in place, his fingers curl into my hair, fisting his hands. My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. My breath hitches. God, he's so fucked-up. <p> Moving suddenly, he slams me against the desk. He holds me against his hips, and I groan loudly, panting. He trails his fingertips gently down my belly. I inhale sharply. How does he have this power over me?<p>
