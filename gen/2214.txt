I want him so badly. That look!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, warmth pooling below my waist. His mouth is on mine, and I tingle ... everywhere. His tongue invades my mouth, dominating, raising uncontrollable urges in me. I can hear a song by Miley Cyrus drifting through the air. I love his choice. Holding my head in place, he curls his fingers into my hair, fisting his hands. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the desk. It's so hot, making me writhe. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and I am all sensation. I'm going to combust. <p>
