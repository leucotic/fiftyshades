He grins against my neck. My mouth goes dry. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Here? ,' he growls teasingly, sparking electricity ... below. <p> 'Please...' I exhale . <p> He smirks. 'Good girl.' He caresses my cheek, gazing at me lovingly, making me tremble. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my heart skips a beat. He kisses me, insistent, dominating. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and my muscles clench deep inside me. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, igniting a fire deep within, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place as we kiss, forcefully. My inner goddess is thrilled. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the wall. It's pleasure overload, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He softly trails his fingers across my thighs. I groan loudly, panting. How does he have this power over me?
