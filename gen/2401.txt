He smirks at me. Jeez, he's so hard to please. Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> 'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he breathes, his gaze burning, and tingling shoots through me as I tingle ... everywhere. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'Tell me what you want,' he whispers, his voice low. He touches my face gently, igniting my blood. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my bottom lip, dominating, making my muscles clench in response. Tasting, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. He kisses me, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. He grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. <p> All of a sudden, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the wall. All the air leaves my body, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He softly kisses my face, forceful, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. My heart is pounding.
