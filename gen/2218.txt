I want him so badly. That look!<p> 'You. Are. So. Beautiful,' he whispers, staring intently into my eyes. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my temple, tasting, sparking electricity ... below. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting a fire deep within, making my muscles clench in response. He softly kisses my throat, and I tingle ... everywhere. His mouth is on mine, dominating, raising uncontrollable urges in me. I yelp, and his hand tightens around my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, forcefully. My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> Suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the bedpost. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His hands skim down my body gently. I'm going to combust. How can he do this to me?<p>
