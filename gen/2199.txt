He stalks gracefully forward. If only it didn't take a contract and rope to please him. His rope is coiled on the foot of the bed. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'You were very disobedient,' he murmurs. His eyes are darkening, and everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Yes.' I swallow. <p> He smirks. 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you.' He caresses my cheek, gazing at me tenderly, raising uncontrollable urges in me. <p> Leaning down, he kisses me, exploring, shallowing my breath. Exploring, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. Tasting, dominating, he kisses me. The sensual strains of Tallis drift through the headphones he put on me. I love his choice. He curls his fingers into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the desk. It's so hot, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. His mouth is on mine, his eyes wild, making me yearn for him. It's so hot.
