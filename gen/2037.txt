He smirks at me. If only it didn't take a contract and a pair of handcuffs to satisfy him. Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> 'Do you want to play? ,' he murmurs. His breathing is harsh, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He caresses my hair, gazing at me tenderly, igniting a fire deep within. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, making me squirm. He kisses me, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. Dominating, his eyes glowing with lust, exploring, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. He softly kisses my face, tasting, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, running his fingers through my hair. My inner goddess is thrilled. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the bedpost. I inhale sharply, making me yearn for him. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, making me yearn for him. All the air leaves my body.
