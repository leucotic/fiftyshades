Leaning down, he softly kisses my face, dominating, coursing heat throughout my body. He softly kisses my throat, exploring, igniting a fire deep within. He kisses me, and my muscles clench deep inside me. He softly kisses my temple, insistent, shallowing my breath, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, he curls his fingers around my head, holding tight. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance. <p> 'Turn around.' <p> His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. I glance nervously at the playroom. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the bedpost. My breathing is too loud, making me yearn for him. His fingers run up my thighs softly. I practically convulse. How can he turn me on with one word?
