Holy cow. That gaze!<p> 'God, I need you,' he breathes, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and my breath hitches. He kisses me, insistent. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, frantically, he curls his fingers around my head, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> Abruptly, he pushes me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. His fingers trail down my body. My pulse is haywire. I blush , feeling my face flame. <i>Holy cow</i>. <p>
