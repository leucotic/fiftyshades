Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. <i>Oh my</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> 'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he breathes. His gaze is softly luminous in the diffuse glow of the lamp, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. <p> 'Yes,' I exhale . <p> 'This is not going to hurt. It will be intense,' he murmurs, his eyes darkest slate. He caresses my cheek, gazing at me lovingly, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, making me tremble. Dominating, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. I can hear a song by Justin Bieber drifting through the air. I love his choice. Holding my head in place, he curls his fingers into my hair, fisting his hands. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the desk. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, making me yearn for him. His hands trace down my belly so that I am all sensation. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>I want him so badly</i>.
