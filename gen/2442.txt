'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he growls, his breathing harsh, and everything in my body tightens as a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I glance nervously at the doorway. <p> He lifts my chin, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, insistent, his eyes glowing with lust. He softly kisses my throat, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. He softly kisses my cheek, dominating, sending shivers down my spine. His fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place. My subconscious is purring with pleasure. <p> That flogger! We've never used a flogger before. I tremble anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> Suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the wall. My pulse is haywire, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. He trails his hands gently across my body, and desire courses through my blood. I flush scarlet. <i>Holy shit</i>. <p>
