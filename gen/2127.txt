Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. I tremble anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. His fingers brush the cuffs, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. <p> 'You were very disobedient,' he growls. His breathing is low, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> 'Yes.' I swallow. <p> 'Good,' he breathes, his eyes smouldering. He touches my face gently, making me tremble. <p> He reaches down, and my breathing accelerates. He softly kisses my face, exploring. His tongue invades my mouth, dominating, igniting a fire deep within, shallowing my breath. I squirm against him, and his fingers curl into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious is screaming at me. <p> All of a sudden, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the doorway. All the air leaves my body, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. He skims his hands down my back, and desire seizes me with a vengeance. How can he turn me on with one word?
