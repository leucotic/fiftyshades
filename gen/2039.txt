'Do you want me? ,' he murmurs. His breathing is husky, and my muscles clench deep inside me. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> Leaning down, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, igniting a fire deep within. His mouth is on mine, dominating, raising uncontrollable urges in me, igniting my blood. He grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious is purring with pleasure. <p> His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. My heart starts pounding in anticipation. If only it didn't take a contract and a pair of handcuffs to satisfy him. <p> Catching me off guard, he slams me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and fuck, I'm panting already. His fingertips softly trace down my thighs so that I am awash with sensation. How can he turn me on with one word?<p>
