He straightens. If only it didn't take a contract and a pair of handcuffs to please him. His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. His fingers brush the cuffs, and tingling shoots through me. <p> 'You were very disobedient,' he breathes, his eyes smoky, and my muscles clench deep inside me as I tingle ... everywhere. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' I swallow. <p> He smirks. 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you.' He cups my face gently, making my muscles clench in response. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He kisses me, tasting, raising uncontrollable urges in me, igniting my blood. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, igniting a fire deep within. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. I gasp and moan , and he curls his fingers around my head, pulling my head back as we kiss. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the desk. It's so hot, making me yearn for him. His hands run up my thighs softly. It's so hot. How can his body do this to me?
