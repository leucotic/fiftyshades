Shit. That look!<p> 'God, I need you,' he murmurs, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, exploring, sending delicious shivers down my spine. His mouth is on mine, insistent, igniting a fire deep within. He softly kisses my temple, and an electric thrill thrums through me. He kisses me, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I yelp, and his hand tightens around my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, forcefully. My subconscious is purring with pleasure. <p> Abruptly, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the wall. It's so hot, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His fingers run along my body. It's pleasure overload. How does he have this power over me?<p>
