'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he whispers, his eyes smoky, and desire unfurls deep in my belly as a delicious tingling shoots through me. <p> 'Please...' I exhale . <p> 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you,' he breathes, his breathing hard. <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I breathe. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He softly kisses my temple, his eyes glowing with lust. His mouth is on mine, and my muscles clench deep inside me. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding me gently in place. My subconscious is purring with pleasure.
