Without warning, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the desk. It's so hot, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. He gently trails his fingers up my back. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me. I blush deeply. <i>Holy shit</i>. <p> He lifts my chin, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. His tongue invades my mouth, insistent. He kisses me, and everything in my body tightens. Dominating, exploring, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. I bite my lip, and one of his hands moves into my hair, holding my head in place. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance.
