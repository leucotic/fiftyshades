He leans in, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. He softly kisses my temple, insistent. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. Exploring, he kisses me. The sultry strains of Kings of Leon waft through the air. I love his choice. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. <p> 'Turn around.' <p> His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. <i>Holy crap</i>. His fingers brush the paddle, and everything in my body tightens. <p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he breathes, staring intently into my eyes. Without warning, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the bedpost. I'm going to combust, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. His mouth is on mine, and I lose myself to his fervent passion. It's so hot.
