His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I tremble anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. His eyes glance over the instrument, and I tingle ... everywhere. <p> 'Ready?,' he whispers, his voice hard, and an electric thrill thrums through me as desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He touches my face gently, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. <p> He reaches down, and my breathing accelerates. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, insistent. He kisses me, dominating, coursing heat throughout my body, my insides liquefying. I gasp and moan against his lips, and his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, pulling my head back as we kiss. My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> All of a sudden, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the wall. I'm going to combust, making me yearn for him, making me yearn for him. His fingertips gently trail down my back, and desire courses through my blood. How can he turn me on with one word?
