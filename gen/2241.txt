Oh, I want this. That gaze!<p> 'I want you so much,' he breathes, staring intently into my eyes. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, coursing heat throughout my body. Tasting, his eyes glowing with lust, he softly kisses my temple. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, igniting a fire deep within, making me squirm. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. I moan again into his mouth, and one of his hands moves into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss. My subconscious is staring at me in awe. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the wall. My breathing is too loud, making me yearn for him. His tongue invades my mouth, and desire courses through my blood. I inhale sharply. <p>
