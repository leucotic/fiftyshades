I want him so badly. That sex appeal!<p> 'I want you so much,' he breathes, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Leaning down, his tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, warmth pooling below my waist. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, my insides liquefying, sending shivers down my spine. Exploring, dominating, exploring, he kisses me. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, igniting a fire deep within, raising uncontrollable urges in me. I can hear music faintly. How unexpected. His fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place. <p> Catching me off guard, he slams me against the bedpost. He restrains me with his hips, and I inhale sharply. Lustful, forceful, he softly kisses my bottom lip. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. <p>
