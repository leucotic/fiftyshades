He straightens. If only it didn't take a contract and a leather strap to satisfy him. That leather strap! We've never used a leather strap before. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Here? ,' he growls. His breathing is husky, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. <p> 'Okay,' I exhale . <p> He smiles teasingly. 'This is not going to hurt. It will be intense.' He cups my face gently, raising uncontrollable urges in me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting a fire deep within. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. Dominating, he softly kisses my throat. His mouth is on mine, insistent, warmth pooling below my waist. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. He curls his fingers into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss. <p> Abruptly, he pushes me against the desk. He holds me against his hips, and I inhale sharply. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and I lose myself to his fervent passion. Fuck, I'm panting already.
