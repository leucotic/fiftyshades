Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my temple, insistent, making me squirm. He kisses me, dominating, igniting a fire deep within, igniting a fire deep within. He kisses me, insistent, igniting my blood. I moan into his mouth, and his fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss. My inner goddess does a slow erotic dance. <p> 'Face the wall.' <p> He smiles a slow sexy smile. Jeez, he's so complicated. That leather strap! We've never used a leather strap before. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he growls, pinning me with his bold gaze. Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the bedpost. I inhale sharply, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He trails his fingers softly along my body so that desire and anxiety pump through me. How can he turn me on with one word?
