'Do you want to play? ,' he growls. His eyes are smoky, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'Good girl,' he breathes, his breathing harsh. <p> 'Surprise me,' I whisper. <p> Leaning down, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting a fire deep within. Insistent, tasting, exploring, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, shallowing my breath. He curls his fingers around my head, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My inner goddess is purring with pleasure.
