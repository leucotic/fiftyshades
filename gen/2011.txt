Oh my. That power!<p> 'Keep still,' he breathes as he hovers over me. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my bottom lip, tasting, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, sparking electricity ... below. Insistent, exploring, dominating, he kisses me. I can hear a song by Justin Bieber drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I gasp at his words , and his fingers curl into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the desk. All the air leaves my body, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. I groan loudly, panting. <p>
