Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the wall. It's pleasure overload, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. Lustful, his eyes wild, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. Fuck, I'm panting already. <p> He leans in, and my stomach somersaults. He kisses me, dominating, insistent, exploring. His tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, anticipation and anxiety charging through me, my insides liquefying. I bite my lip, and he curls his fingers into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious does the samba.
