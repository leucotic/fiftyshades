'Ready?,' he whispers, his breathing husky, and everything in my body tightens as tingling shoots through me. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> He reaches down, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He kisses me, insistent. He softly kisses my bottom lip, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. One of his hands moves into my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss, frantically. My inner goddess is thrilled. <p> He stalks gracefully forward. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. That paddle! We've never used a paddle before. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the bedpost. I inhale sharply, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. Forceful, his tongue invades my mouth. Fuck, I'm panting already. <p>
