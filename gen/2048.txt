'Ready?,' he breathes. His breathing is husky, and my muscles clench deep inside me. I glance nervously at the playroom. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my face, insistent, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. His mouth is on mine, dominating, shallowing my breath. I can hear music faintly. How appropriate. I gasp and moan against his lips, and one of his hands moves into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss. <p> He smirks at me. Jeez, he's so complicated. His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> Suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the desk. I groan loudly, panting, making me writhe. He runs his fingers along my body, and my body rises and fills with my arousal. I blush scarlet, ashamed and turned on at the same time. <i>I want him so badly</i>. <p>
