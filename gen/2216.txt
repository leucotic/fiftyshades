His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. <i>Holy cow</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'Do you want me? ,' he growls. His gaze is smouldering, and I tingle ... everywhere. <p> 'Yes...' I breathe . <p> His lips part. 'I want to hear you .' He caresses my cheek, gazing at me tenderly, making me tremble. <p> He lifts my chin, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, insistent. His mouth is on mine, exploring, warmth pooling below my waist. Tasting, he kisses me. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, warmth pooling below my waist, warmth pooling below my waist. I gasp and moan , and he curls his fingers around my head, holding my head in place as we kiss. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the desk. I'm going to combust, making me yearn for him, making me yearn for him. He runs his hands down my belly so that I am awash with sensation. How can his body do this to me?
