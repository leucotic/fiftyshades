'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he growls. His eyes are scorching molten gray, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes...' I exhale . <p> He smiles wickedly. 'Good girl.' <p> 'Take me,' I whisper. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, my insides liquefying. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and an electric thrill thrums through me. He kisses me, dominating, sparking electricity ... below, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. The sultry strains of Miley Cyrus drift through the headphones he put on me. He always puts songs on repeat in here. I yelp, and his fingers curl into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face.
