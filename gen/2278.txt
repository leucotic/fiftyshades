'Ready?,' he growls, his voice husky, and a delicious tingling shoots through me as desire unfurls deep in my belly. My heart skips a beat. <p> Leaning down, his tongue invades my mouth, insistent, shallowing my breath. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and an electric thrill thrums through me. He kisses me, exploring, warmth pooling below my waist, coursing heat throughout my body. I can hear a song by Kings of Leon drifting through the air. How unexpected. I yelp, and his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding my head in place as we kiss, forcefully. <p> Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Suddenly, he slams me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and I groan, frustrated. His fingertips gently trace up my belly. I groan loudly, panting. How does he have this power over me?<p>
