Shit. That look!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he growls, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> He reaches down, and my stomach somersaults. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, tasting. He kisses me, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, his fingers curl into my hair, fisting his hands. My subconscious is purring with pleasure. <p> Catching me off guard, he pushes me against the bedpost. He restrains me with his hips, and I practically convulse. He softly kisses my temple, lustful, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. My breathing is too loud. <p>
