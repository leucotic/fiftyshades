That flogger! We've never used a flogger before. <i>I want him so badly</i>. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'Do you want me? ,' he murmurs, his breathing husky, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body as desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He smiles wickedly. 'Good.' He caresses my cheek, gazing at me lovingly, my insides liquefying. <p> Leaning down, he kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting my blood. His mouth is on mine, and an electric thrill thrums through me. His eyes glowing with lust, insistent, exploring, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. Tasting, dominating, he softly kisses my temple. I squirm against him, and his hand tightens around my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss, savagely. My subconscious is screaming at me. <p> Moving suddenly, he pushes me against the bedpost. He restrains me with his hips, and all the air leaves my body. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and I am awash with sensation. It's pleasure overload.
