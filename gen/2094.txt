Leaning down, he kisses me, dominating, making me tremble. Tasting, insistent, exploring, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. He softly kisses my cheek, tasting, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, igniting my blood. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. The pulsing strains of Kings of Leon waft through the air. How unexpected. I squirm against him, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, pulling my head back as we kiss, savagely. <p> 'Get on the bed,' he murmurs, and I comply immediately. <p> Those nipple clamps! We've never used a pair of nipple clamps before. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. Jeez, he's so hard to please. <p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he breathes as he hovers over me. Moving suddenly, he shoves me against the desk. He restrains me with his hips, and it's so eroticâ€”his need for me. Frantic, forceful, his mouth is on mine. Fuck, I'm panting already.
