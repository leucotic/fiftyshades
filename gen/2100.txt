'Ready?,' he breathes, his breathing husky, and everything in my body tightens as tingling shoots through me. My breath hitches. <p> He reaches down, and my breathing accelerates. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating. Dominating, his eyes glowing with lust, he softly kisses my temple. He kisses me, and my muscles clench deep inside me. His mouth is on mine, dominating, warmth pooling below my waist, coursing heat throughout my body. The sensual strains of Kings of Leon waft through the air. How appropriate. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, he curls his fingers around my head, running his fingers through my hair. <p> He smirks at me. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the doorway. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, making me writhe. His fingertips run up my neck gently so that I'm drowning in a pool of desire. How can he turn me on with one word?<p>
