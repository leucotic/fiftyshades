He lifts my chin, and my breathing accelerates. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, insistent, tasting. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and everything in my body tightens. His eyes glowing with lust, insistent, he kisses me. He curls his fingers around my head, pulling my head back. My inner goddess is thrilled. <p> 'Turn around,' he growls, and I comply immediately. <p> His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I glance nervously at the playroom. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'You. Are. So. Sweet,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. Suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the bedpost. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. He skims his hands along my body gently, and desire seizes me with a vengeance. I blush deeply, humiliated and turned on at the same time. <i>Holy shit</i>.
