'Here? ,' he whispers, his eyes burning, and an electric thrill thrums through me as my muscles clench deep inside me. <p> 'Please...' I whisper . <p> His lips part. 'I want to hear you scream for me.' <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I breathe. <p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and I'm quaking like a leaf. His mouth is on mine, tasting, insistent. His mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>, coursing heat throughout my body. Dominating, insistent, his eyes glowing with lust, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. He grabs my hair and yanks down, pulling my head back. My subconscious does the samba.
