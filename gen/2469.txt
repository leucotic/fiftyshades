'Do you want me? ,' he whispers, his gaze burning, and I tingle ... everywhere as dark desire unfolds throughout my body. My heart starts pounding. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, igniting my blood. He kisses me, tasting, making me tremble, my insides liquefying. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and tingling shoots through me. I can hear a song by Miley Cyrus drifting through the air. I love his choice. Holding me firmly in place as we kiss, one of his hands moves into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. <p> Those nipple clamps! We've never used a pair of nipple clamps before. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the wall. I inhale sharply, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He kisses me, lustful, making me writhe. My breathing is too loud. <p>
