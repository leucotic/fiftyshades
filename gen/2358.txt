'Do you want me? ,' he whispers in my ear, shallowing my breath. I glance anxiously at the playroom. <p> Leaning down, his tongue invades my mouth, exploring, making me tremble. He softly kisses my throat, tasting, igniting a fire deep within, raising uncontrollable urges in me. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding my head in place as we kiss, forcefully. My subconscious is purring with pleasure. <p> His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. My heart skips a beat. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> Catching me off guard, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the wall. It's so hot, making me writhe. His fingers skim down my body so that I lose myself to his fervent passion. How does he have this power over me?<p>
