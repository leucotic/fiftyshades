Holy crap. That look!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he whispers as he hovers over me. <p> He leans in, and my heart skips a beat. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, exploring. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, making me squirm, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. His tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, coursing heat throughout my body, making me tremble. His mouth is on mine, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. The sultry strains of Kings of Leon drift through the headphones he put on me. I love his choice. His hand tightens around my hair, holding my head in place. <p> Catching me off guard, he pushes me against the desk. He's pinning me to the desk using his hips, and my heart is pounding. He softly traces his fingers along my neck. I groan loudly, panting. How can his body do this to me?<p>
