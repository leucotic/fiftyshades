Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the bedpost. I inhale sharply, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. His eyes wild, he kisses me. Fuck, I'm panting already. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, dominating, igniting a fire deep within. He kisses me, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His hand tightens around my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face.
