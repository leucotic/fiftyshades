'Ready?,' he whispers. His eyes are softly luminous in the diffuse glow of the lamp, and everything in my body tightens. I tremble anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, shallowing my breath. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting my blood, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. I moan, and his hand tightens around my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> He grins against my neck. God, he's so fucked-up. His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Catching me off guard, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the bedpost. I practically convulse, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His fingertips run up my belly. Fuck, I'm panting already. I blush scarlet, ashamed and excited at the same time. <i>Holy crap</i>. <p>
