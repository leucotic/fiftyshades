I practically convulse. How can his body do this to me?<p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He softly kisses my throat, tasting, his eyes glowing with lust, dominating. He kisses me, and an electric thrill thrums through me. One of his hands moves into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss, savagely. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves.
