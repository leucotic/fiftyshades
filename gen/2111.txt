'Here? ,' he murmurs, his gaze smoky, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me as an electric thrill thrums through me. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes,' I exhale . <p> He smirks. 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you.' <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I whisper. <p> He leans in, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He softly kisses my face, tasting, his eyes glowing with lust, tasting. Dominating, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. He kisses me, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, shallowing my breath. His fingers curl into my hair, holding me gently in place. My subconscious is staring at me in awe.
