'Ready?,' he breathes. His eyes are smouldering, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I glance anxiously at the doorway. <p> Leaning down, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, sparking electricity ... below. He softly kisses my face, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. His tongue invades my mouth, exploring, warmth pooling below my waist, coursing heat throughout my body. His eyes glowing with lust, exploring, dominating, he kisses me. I squirm against him, and his fingers curl into my hair, holding me gently in place. My inner goddess is screaming at me. <p> He straightens. Boy, he's so complicated. That rope! We've never used rope before. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Moving suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the wall. I groan loudly, panting, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. He runs his hands gently up my neck. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. I flush scarlet. <i>Holy shit</i>. <p>
