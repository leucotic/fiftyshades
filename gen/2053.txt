'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he breathes. His voice is harsh, and I tingle ... everywhere. I glance nervously at the doorway. <p> He lifts my chin, and my stomach somersaults. His mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, making me squirm, igniting a fire deep within. He grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place. My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. <i>Holy shit</i>. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> Without warning, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the doorway. I inhale sharply, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His hands trace across my body softly. My pulse is haywire. How can he do this to me?<p>
