'Ready?,' he growls, his eyes darkening, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body as a delicious tingling shoots through me. My breath hitches. <p> He leans in, and my breathing accelerates. His mouth is on mine, exploring. He kisses me, insistent, sparking electricity ... below. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I can hear a song by Kings of Leon drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His fingers curl into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. <p> He smirks at me. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Abruptly, he shoves me against the bedpost. He's pinning me to the bedpost using his hips, and my pulse is haywire. His fingertips trace across my belly. It's pleasure overload. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Oh my</i>. <p>
