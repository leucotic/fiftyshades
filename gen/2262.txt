He runs his nose along my jaw, and my heart skips a beat. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, his eyes glowing with lust. Tasting, insistent, he softly kisses my cheek. His tongue invades my mouth, exploring, igniting a fire deep within, making me squirm. I can hear music faintly. How appropriate. Pulling my head back, he curls his fingers into my hair, fisting his hands. <p> 'Face the wall.' <p> His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. God, he's so fucked-up. <p> 'God, I need you,' he growls as he hovers over me. Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the wall. I groan loudly, panting, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, forceful, making me writhe. Fuck, I'm panting already.
