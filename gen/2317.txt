Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my temple, insistent, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, shallowing my breath, sparking electricity ... below. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. I yelp, and one of his hands moves into my hair, holding my head in place. <p> 'On your knees,' he murmurs, warmth pooling below my waist and making me squirm. <p> His rope is coiled on the foot of the bed. <i>Holy shit</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'God, I need you,' he whispers as he hovers over me. All of a sudden, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the doorway. I inhale sharply, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. Forceful, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. I groan, frustrated.
