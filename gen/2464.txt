'You were very disobedient,' he murmurs, his breathing husky, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me as my muscles clench deep inside me. <p> 'Okay.' I swallow. <p> 'Good girl. This is not going to hurt. It will be intense.' <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I breathe. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my bottom lip, exploring, coursing heat throughout my body. Tasting, exploring, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, forcefully, he curls his fingers around my head, running his fingers through my hair. My inner goddess has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly.
