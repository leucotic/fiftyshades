Holy cow. That look!<p> 'I want you so much,' he murmurs, staring intently into my eyes. <p> Tipping my chin back, his tongue invades my mouth, dominating, coursing heat throughout my body. His mouth is on mine, and everything in my body tightens. I can hear music faintly. I love his choice. I gasp and moan against his lips, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. <p> Catching me off guard, he shoves me against the bedpost. He holds me against his hips, and all the air leaves my body. He trails his fingers along my body so that I am all sensation. I blush , feeling my face flame, humiliated and turned on at the same time. <i>Oh my</i>. <p>
