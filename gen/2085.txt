'Here? ,' he whispers, his breathing husky, and an electric thrill thrums through me as a delicious tingling shoots through me. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, tasting. He softly kisses my temple, and my muscles clench deep inside me. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and an electric thrill thrums through me. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, making my muscles clench in response, making me squirm. I gasp at his words , and he curls his fingers into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss, forcefully. My inner goddess is staring at me in awe. <p> He straightens. If only it didn't take a contract and a pair of handcuffs to please him. His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the wall. I groan, frustrated, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. He trails his fingers up my body so that my body rises and fills with my arousal. I blush deeply, ashamed and excited at the same time. <i>Holy cow</i>. <p>
