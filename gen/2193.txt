'Do you want to play? ,' he growls, his breathing low, and desire unfurls deep in my belly as a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> 'Yes,' I whisper . <p> He smirks. 'This is not going to hurt. It will be intense.' <p> 'Surprise me,' I breathe. <p> Leaning down, he kisses me, exploring, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. His fingers curl into my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss. My subconscious does a slow erotic dance.
