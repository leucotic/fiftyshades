Oh my. That look!<p> 'God, I need you,' he growls, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> He reaches down, and my stomach somersaults. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, tasting, tasting. Dominating, he kisses me. He softly kisses my cheek, exploring, sending delicious shivers down my spine, making me squirm. I can hear music faintly. How appropriate. He curls his fingers around my head, holding me gently in place. <p> Abruptly, he pushes me against the doorway. He holds me against his hips, and it's pleasure overload. His mouth is on mine, lustful, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. <p>
