He grins against my neck. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. His paddle lies casually on his imposing, leather-topped desk. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he murmurs. His breathing is harsh, and an electric thrill thrums through me. <p> 'Yes.' I swallow. <p> 'This is not going to hurt. It will be intense,' he growls, his breathing hard. He touches my face gently, making me tremble. <p> He reaches down, and my breath hitches. He kisses me, tasting. Exploring, he kisses me. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, making my muscles clench in response, shallowing my breath. I moan into his mouth, and his fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place. My subconscious has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly. <p> Without warning, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the doorway. It's pleasure overload, making me yearn for him. His fingertips trace across my neck. My pulse is haywire. I flush , feeling my face flame. <i>Holy shit</i>.
