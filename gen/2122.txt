He reaches down, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. His mouth is on mine, tasting, exploring. Insistent, insistent, his eyes glowing with lust, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. His mouth is on mine, exploring, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly, my insides liquefying. He grabs my hair and yanks down, pulling my head back as we kiss. My subconscious does the samba. <p> 'Get on the bed,' he whispers, anticipation and anxiety charging through me and sending delicious shivers down my spine. <p> He smiles a slow sexy smile. If only it didn't take a contract and a pair of handcuffs to please him. His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he murmurs, staring intently into my eyes. Catching me off guard, he pushes me against the desk. He restrains me with his hips, and my breathing is too loud. He softly kisses my bottom lip, exploring, making me yearn for him. Fuck, I'm panting already.
