'Ready?,' he growls, his breathing harsh, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body as I tingle ... everywhere. I glance nervously at the playroom. <p> Leaning down, he kisses me, insistent, raising uncontrollable urges in me. His mouth is on mine, tasting, raising uncontrollable urges in me, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. His eyes glowing with lust, exploring, dominating, his tongue invades my mouth. His mouth is on mine, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I squirm against him, and his fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss. My subconscious is thrilled. <p> He smiles a slow sexy smile. I'm suddenly flooded with despair. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. That leather strap! We've never used a leather strap before. His fingers brush the strap, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the desk. It's so hot, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He softly kisses my temple, exploring, making me yearn for him, making me yearn for him. I practically convulse. <p>
