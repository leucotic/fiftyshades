He straightens. If only it didn't take a contract and rope to satisfy him. His rope is coiled on the foot of the bed. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'You were very disobedient,' he murmurs. His eyes are burning brighter, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. <p> 'Please...' I whisper . <p> He touches my face gently, igniting a fire deep within. <p> He lifts my chin, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, dominating. Insistent, his eyes glowing with lust, he softly kisses my cheek. He kisses me, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. I can hear music faintly. How unexpected. Holding me gently in place as we kiss, he grabs my hair and yanks down, running his fingers through my hair. <p> Without warning, he pushes me against the doorway. He holds me against his hips, and I groan loudly, panting. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, lustful, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. It's so hot.
