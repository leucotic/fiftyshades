All of a sudden, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the bedpost. I groan loudly, panting, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. He gently skims his fingertips up my belly, and my craving spirals out of control. I blush from my head to my toes, ashamed and excited at the same time. <i>Crap</i>. <p> He lifts my chin, and my breathing accelerates. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating. He softly kisses my temple, exploring, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. How unexpected. I yelp, and his fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss.
