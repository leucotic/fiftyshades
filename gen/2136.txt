'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he whispers. His breathing is harsh, and my muscles clench deep inside me. I glance nervously at the doorway. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my face, tasting, coursing heat throughout my body. Exploring, he kisses me. Tasting, his tongue invades my mouth. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. The haunting strains of Justin Bieber drift through the headphones he put on me. How appropriate. I gasp at his words , and he curls his fingers around my head, pulling my head back. <p> His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I glance anxiously at the bed. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the desk. It's so hot, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He softly kisses my bottom lip, and I surrender briefly to the sensation. Fuck, I'm panting already. <p>
