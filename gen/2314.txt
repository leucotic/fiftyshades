'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he whispers, his eyes stormy, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body as an electric thrill thrums through me. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you,' he murmurs, his voice harsh. <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I whisper. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my cheek, exploring, shallowing my breath. He softly kisses my face, his eyes glowing with lust, making my muscles clench in response, raising uncontrollable urges in me. I gasp and moan , and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding me gently in place. My subconscious glares at me.
