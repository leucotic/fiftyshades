'Do you want me? ,' he whispers, his voice harsh, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body as desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> 'Yes...' I breathe . <p> 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you,' he murmurs, his gaze gray. <p> 'Surprise me,' I whisper. <p> Tipping my chin back, his tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, warmth pooling below my waist. Dominating, tasting, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. He softly kisses my cheek, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. He curls his fingers into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, savagely. My inner goddess does a slow erotic dance.
