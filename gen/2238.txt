Oh my. That sex appeal!<p> 'God, I need you,' he murmurs, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my temple, insistent, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. Exploring, tasting, his eyes glowing with lust, his mouth is on mine. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and my muscles clench deep inside me. I can hear a song by Kings of Leon drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back. <p> Suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the bedpost. It's pleasure overload, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His fingertips skim up my neck gently. All the air leaves my body. How can his body do this to me?<p>
