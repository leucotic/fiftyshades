'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he growls in my ear, my insides liquefying. I glance anxiously at the doorway. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, making my muscles clench in response. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, insistent, shallowing my breath. I gasp and moan , and he curls his fingers around my head, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My inner goddess swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> He stalks gracefully forward. If only it didn't take a contract and a flogger to satisfy him. His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the desk. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He softly kisses my temple, and I'm drowning in a pool of desire. My heart is pounding. <p>
