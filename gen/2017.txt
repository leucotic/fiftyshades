'Here? ,' he breathes. His breathing is hard, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, igniting a fire deep within. Exploring, dominating, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. His mouth is on mine, tasting, raising uncontrollable urges in me. I gasp at his words , and his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. My inner goddess swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> He stalks gracefully forward. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>those</i>. <p> All of a sudden, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the doorway. It's so hot, making me writhe, making me writhe. He kisses me, his eyes wild, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. It's pleasure overload. <p>
