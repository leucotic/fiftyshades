'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he whispers teasingly, making me tremble. <p> 'Okay.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'Good girl. Remember, I'll never hurt you.' <p> 'Take me,' I breathe. <p> Tipping my chin back, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting my blood. He softly kisses my throat, and an electric thrill thrums through me. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, warmth pooling below my waist. Exploring, he softly kisses my temple. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, he curls his fingers into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head.
