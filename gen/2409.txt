'You were very disobedient,' he whispers in my ear, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. <p> 'Okay...' I whisper . <p> His lips tense. 'This is not going to hurt. It will be intense.' <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I exhale. <p> Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, dominating, sending delicious shivers down my spine. Insistent, dominating, his eyes glowing with lust, he kisses me. I can hear a song by Justin Bieber drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. He grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss.
