He leans in, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He softly kisses my face, his eyes glowing with lust, tasting, his eyes glowing with lust. His mouth is on mine, and everything in my body tightens. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, making me tremble, raising uncontrollable urges in me. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. How unexpected. He curls his fingers around my head, pulling my head back. <p> 'Get on the bed.' <p> Those handcuffs! We've never used a pair of handcuffs before. I glance anxiously at the playroom. My mouth goes dry. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> 'You are so beautiful,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the wall. My heart is pounding, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. His fingers skim up my back, and I am awash with sensation. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Holy cow</i>.
