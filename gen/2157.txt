Oh my. That power!<p> 'I want you so much,' he growls as he hovers over me. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, coursing heat throughout my body. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, tasting, igniting my blood, warmth pooling below my waist. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, pulling my head back. My subconscious is thrilled. <p> Without warning, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the doorway. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. His fingers trace up my body gently. It's so hot. I blush scarlet, ashamed and excited at the same time. <i>I want him so badly</i>. <p>
