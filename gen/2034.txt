That leather strap! We've never used a leather strap before. I glance anxiously at the bed. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> 'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he growls, his eyes smoky, and tingling shoots through me as my muscles clench deep inside me. <p> 'Okay...' I whisper . <p> 'Good,' he whispers, his breathing low. He caresses my hair, gazing at me tenderly, making me tremble. <p> Leaning down, his mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, making me tremble. Dominating, his tongue invades my mouth. Holding me gently in place, he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding tight. My subconscious glares at me. <p> All of a sudden, he slams me against the wall. He holds me against his hips, and my breathing is too loud. He trails his hands across my thighs, and I surrender briefly to the sensation. I blush scarlet. <i>Holy shit</i>.
