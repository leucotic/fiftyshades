Holy hell. That sex appeal!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. <p> He reaches down, and my heart starts pounding in anticipation. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, his eyes glowing with lust. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, raising uncontrollable urges in me, sending delicious shivers down my spine. He softly kisses my temple, tasting, making me tremble, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. I moan again into his mouth, and one of his hands moves into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss. My subconscious is thrilled. <p> Without warning, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the desk. I groan, frustrated, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His eyes wild, he kisses me. It's so hot. <p>
