Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my temple, dominating, igniting my blood. Exploring, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. His mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, sparking electricity ... below. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, one of his hands moves into my hair, fisting his hands. My subconscious does the samba. <p> 'Turn around,' he growls, and I comply immediately. <p> His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. God, he's so fucked-up. <p> 'You are so beautiful,' he murmurs, staring intently into my eyes. Without warning, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the doorway. All the air leaves my body, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, lustful, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. I practically convulse.
