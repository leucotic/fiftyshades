His skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, shallowing my breath. He softly kisses my throat, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. His hand tightens around my hair, holding me firmly in place.

He plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. I groan loudly, panting.
