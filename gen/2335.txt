'Do you want to play? ,' he whispers in my ear, my insides liquefying. <p> 'Yes,' I breathe . <p> 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you,' he breathes, his voice husky. <p> 'Surprise me,' I exhale. <p> He reaches down, and my heart starts pounding. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, sending delicious shivers down my spine. Dominating, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. I squirm against him, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, frantically. My inner goddess does the samba.
