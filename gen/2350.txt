Oh my. That sex appeal!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he breathes, staring intently into my eyes. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, coursing heat throughout my body. He softly kisses my throat, tasting, making me tremble, my insides liquefying. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. Insistent, his mouth is on mine. He grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious is screaming at me. <p> All of a sudden, he slams me against the bedpost. He's pinning me to the bedpost using his hips, and my heart is pounding. His fingers trail along my back. I'm going to combust. How can his body do this to me?<p>
