Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, raising uncontrollable urges in me. Tasting, his eyes glowing with lust, he kisses me. His mouth is on mine, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. He softly kisses my temple, and I tingle ... everywhere. I can hear a song by Justin Bieber drifting through the air. I love his choice. He curls his fingers into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss. <p> 'Face the wall,' he murmurs, and I comply immediately. <p> He smiles a slow sexy smile. If only it didn't take a contract and rope to satisfy him. That rope! We've never used rope before. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'I want you so much,' he growls, staring intently into my eyes. Without warning, he shoves me against the desk. He's pinning me to the desk using his hips, and I'm going to combust. His fingertips trail along my body, and my craving spirals out of control. How does he have this power over me?
