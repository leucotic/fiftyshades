Holy crap. That sex appeal!<p> 'Keep still,' he whispers, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, tasting, my insides liquefying. Exploring, his eyes glowing with lust, he softly kisses my cheek. I yelp, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious is staring at me in awe. <p> Abruptly, he slams me against the doorway. He holds me against his hips, and I groan loudly, panting. He skims his hands gently along my body so that my craving spirals out of control. I blush , feeling my face flame. <i>Crap</i>. <p>
