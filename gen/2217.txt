Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my cheek, his eyes glowing with lust, making my muscles clench in response. He kisses me, dominating, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and an electric thrill thrums through me. I moan again , and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding me firmly in place. My subconscious is purring with pleasure. <p> 'Turn around,' he growls, making me squirm and coursing heat throughout my body. <p> He stalks gracefully forward. Boy, he's so complicated. That paddle! We've never used a paddle before. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'You. Are. So. Beautiful,' he murmurs, pinning me with his bold gaze. Catching me off guard, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the desk. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. My pulse is haywire.
