'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he growls, his breathing husky, and everything in my body tightens as a delicious tingling shoots through me. My heart starts pounding in anticipation. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, my insides liquefying. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and an electric thrill thrums through me. Holding me gently in place as we kiss, frantically, he grabs my hair and yanks down, running his fingers through my hair. My inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> Those nipple clamps! We've never used a pair of nipple clamps before. I glance anxiously at the bed. My mouth goes dry. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. <p> Abruptly, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the desk. My breathing is too loud, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He trails his hands along my neck gently, and I surrender briefly to the sensation. How can he turn me on with one word?<p>
