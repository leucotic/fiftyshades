That flogger! We've never used a flogger before. My breath hitches. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he growls. His breathing is husky, and everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes,' I exhale . <p> 'Good,' he breathes, his gaze smoky. His fingers brush my face gently, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, shallowing my breath. His mouth is on mine, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. I can hear a song by Tallis drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. He grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. <p> All of a sudden, he pushes me against the bedpost. He holds me against his hips, and I groan, frustrated. His hands gently run along my back so that my craving spirals out of control. I blush from my head to my toes, humiliated and turned on at the same time. <i>Holy cow</i>.
