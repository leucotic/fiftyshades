Holy cow. That sex appeal!<p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he whispers, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> He lifts my chin, and I'm quaking like a leaf. His mouth is on mine, dominating, tasting. He softly kisses my throat, and an electric thrill thrums through me. The sensual strains of Miley Cyrus drift through the headphones he put on me. How unexpected. He curls his fingers into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss. <p> Moving suddenly, he pushes me against the bedpost. He restrains me with his hips, and I practically convulse. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, lustful, making me writhe, making me writhe. I groan, frustrated. <p>
