Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the wall. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me yearn for him. He softly trails his hands up my back so that I am awash with sensation. How can he turn me on with one word?<p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, dominating, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. Exploring, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. His mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting a fire deep within, making my muscles clench in response. He softly kisses my throat, and I tingle ... everywhere. He grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, savagely. My subconscious is purring with pleasure.
