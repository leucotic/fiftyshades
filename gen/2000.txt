Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, exploring, warmth pooling below my waist. He softly kisses my face, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. He kisses me, and my muscles clench deep inside me. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding my head in place as we kiss, savagely. <p> 'Face the wall,' he whispers, raising uncontrollable urges in me and anticipation and anxiety charging through me. <p> His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. I glance nervously at the playroom. Boy, he's so complicated. <p> 'You. Are. So. Beautiful,' he breathes, staring intently into my eyes. Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the wall. My heart is pounding, making me writhe. His fingers skim up my thighs softly so that my craving spirals out of control. How does he have this power over me?
