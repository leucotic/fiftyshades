He smirks at me. If only it didn't take a contract and a pair of handcuffs to satisfy him. His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'Do you want me? ,' he breathes, his voice low, and everything in my body tightens as an electric thrill thrums through me. <p> 'Yes,' I whisper . <p> He smiles twistedly. 'Good girl.' He caresses my hair, gazing at me lovingly, sending delicious shivers down my spine. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, insistent, my insides liquefying. He softly kisses my throat, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. Exploring, insistent, tasting, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. I can hear music faintly. He always puts songs on repeat in here. His fingers curl into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. <p> Without warning, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the doorway. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me writhe, making me writhe. His fingertips run up my belly gently. I practically convulse. How can his body do this to me?
