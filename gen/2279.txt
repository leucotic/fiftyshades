'You were very disobedient,' he whispers in my ear, warmth pooling below my waist. I glance nervously at the playroom. <p> He lifts my chin, and my breath hitches. He softly kisses my face, tasting, dominating. His eyes glowing with lust, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. I moan again , and he grabs my hair and yanks down, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. My subconscious does the samba. <p> His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I tremble anxiously, excitement blooming deep inside me. His fingers brush the cuffs, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> Suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, shoving me against the doorway. It's pleasure overload, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He kisses me, frantic, making me writhe, making me writhe. I'm going to combust. <p>
