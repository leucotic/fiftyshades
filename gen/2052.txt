Abruptly, he slams me against the desk. He restrains me with his hips, and I groan, frustrated. His fingertips trail up my body so that desire and anxiety pump through me. I blush from my head to my toes, humiliated and excited at the same time. <i>Shit</i>. <p> Tipping my chin back, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. Dominating, his eyes glowing with lust, he softly kisses my face. Tasting, his eyes glowing with lust, insistent, he kisses me. I squirm against him, and one of his hands moves into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious glares at me.
