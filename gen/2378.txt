Abruptly, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the desk. I groan, frustrated, making me writhe. His fingers trail down my back gently so that my craving spirals out of control. How can he turn me on with one word?<p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. His mouth is on mine, and my muscles clench deep inside me. The sensual strains of Kings of Leon waft through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. He curls his fingers around my head, lifting his other hand to cradle my face.
