Oh my. That sex appeal!<p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent. His tongue invades my mouth, and tingling shoots through me. His eyes glowing with lust, dominating, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. One of his hands moves into my hair, holding my head in place. My subconscious does the samba. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the wall. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His fingers gently skim along my belly, and my body rises and fills with my arousal. I blush scarlet, ashamed and excited at the same time. <i>Crap</i>. <p>
