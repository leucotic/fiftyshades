'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he growls teasingly, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. <p> 'Please.' I swallow. <p> He smirks. 'Tell me what you want.' <p> 'Surprise me,' I whisper. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, tasting, sparking electricity ... below. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and an electric thrill thrums through me. Exploring, he softly kisses my cheek. His fingers curl into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, forcefully. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves.
