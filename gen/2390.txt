'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he murmurs. His voice is husky, and tingling shoots through me. I glance nervously at the doorway. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, igniting my blood. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, shallowing my breath. Exploring, dominating, he softly kisses my cheek. Tasting, his mouth is on mine. Holding my head in place, he curls his fingers around my head, holding tight. My subconscious glares at me. <p> His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. My heart skips a beat. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Suddenly, he shoves me against the bedpost. He's pinning me to the bedpost using his hips, and it's pleasure overload. His fingers trace along my belly gently so that my craving spirals out of control. How can he turn me on with one word?<p>
