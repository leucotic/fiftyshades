Holy hell. That look!<p> 'You. Are. So. Beautiful,' he whispers, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. Dominating, he kisses me. I can hear a song by Kings of Leon drifting through the air. He always puts songs on repeat in here. Pulling my head back as we kiss, forcefully, he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding tight. <p> Abruptly, he slams me against the desk. He's pinning me to the desk using his hips, and it's so eroticâ€”his need for me. Forceful, exploring, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. My pulse is haywire. <p>
