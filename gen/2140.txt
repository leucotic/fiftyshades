'Tell me what you want.' <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I breathe. <p> Tipping my chin back, his tongue invades my mouth, dominating, sparking electricity ... below. He softly kisses my face, and an electric thrill thrums through me. Dominating, exploring, his eyes glowing with lust, he kisses me. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss, savagely, he curls his fingers into my hair, fisting his hands. My inner goddess glares at me.
