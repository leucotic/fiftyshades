'Do you want me? ,' he whispers. His gaze is smoky, intense, and my muscles clench deep inside me. I glance nervously at the playroom. <p> He lifts my chin, and I'm quaking like a leaf. His mouth is on mine, dominating, tasting. He kisses me, his eyes glowing with lust, making me squirm, shallowing my breath. He kisses me, and I tingle ... everywhere. I moan into his mouth, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding me firmly in place. My subconscious is thrilled. <p> Those nipple clamps! We've never used a pair of nipple clamps before. <i>Crap</i>. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> Without warning, he pushes me against the bedpost. He restrains me with his hips, and I inhale sharply. His hands run up my neck, and I am all sensation. How can he turn me on with one word?<p>
