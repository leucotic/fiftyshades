His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> 'Do you want me? ,' he whispers, his voice harsh, and tingling shoots through me as a pulse of warmth pools inside me. <p> 'Okay...' I whisper . <p> He caresses my hair, gazing at me lovingly, sending delicious shivers through me ... <i>there</i>. <p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He kisses me, tasting, his eyes glowing with lust. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. Insistent, his mouth is on mine. His tongue invades my mouth, dominating, my insides liquefying, igniting a fire deep within. The sensual strains of Tallis drift through the headphones he put on me. How appropriate. He curls his fingers into my hair, holding my head in place as we kiss. <p> Without warning, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the bedpost. My breathing is too loud, making me writhe. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and desire and anxiety pump through me. My heart is pounding.
