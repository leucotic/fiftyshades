'Do you want to play? ,' he murmurs, his eyes stormy, and everything in my body tightens as I tingle ... everywhere. My breathing accelerates. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, insistent, his eyes glowing with lust. He softly kisses my temple, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I squirm against him, and he curls his fingers around my head, holding me firmly in place. My subconscious is screaming at me. <p> His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. <i>Holy hell</i>. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the bedpost. My pulse is haywire, making me yearn for him, making me yearn for him. His tongue invades my mouth, and desire and anxiety pump through me. Fuck, I'm panting already. <p>
