Abruptly, he shoves me against the desk. He restrains me with his hips, and I practically convulse. His tongue invades my mouth, and I'm drowning in a pool of desire. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. <p> Tipping my chin back, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, tasting, coursing heat throughout my body. Insistent, he softly kisses my bottom lip. I can hear a song by Kings of Leon drifting through the air. I love his choice. One of his hands moves into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss.
