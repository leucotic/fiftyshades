'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he growls, his eyes smouldering, and desire unfurls deep in my belly as everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> His lips tense. 'Good.' <p> 'Take me,' I breathe. <p> Leaning down, his skilled tongue invades my mouth, exploring, igniting my blood. Insistent, exploring, tasting, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. His hand tightens around my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My inner goddess is thrilled.
