Moving suddenly, he pushes me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and I groan loudly, panting. He trails his hands gently up my body, and I'm drowning in a pool of desire. How can his body do this to me?<p> Leaning down, his tongue invades my mouth, tasting, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. Exploring, his eyes glowing with lust, insistent, he kisses me. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, coursing heat throughout my body, igniting a fire deep within. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, his fingers curl into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious is staring at me in awe.
