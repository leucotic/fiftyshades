Holy hell. That look!<p> 'You. Are. So. Beautiful,' he murmurs, pinning me with his bold gaze. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, dominating, coursing heat throughout my body. He softly kisses my throat, insistent, warmth pooling below my waist, igniting my blood. He softly kisses my bottom lip, tasting, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. Exploring, his eyes glowing with lust, he kisses me. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, he grabs my hair and yanks down, fisting his hands. My subconscious is staring at me in awe. <p> All of a sudden, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the desk. Fuck, I'm panting already, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and desire seizes me with a vengeance. I practically convulse. <p>
