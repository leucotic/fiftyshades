'Ready?,' he growls. His breathing is husky, and everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Okay.' I swallow. <p> 'This is not going to hurt. It will be intense. I want to hear you .' <p> 'Surprise me,' I breathe. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my throat, dominating, making me tremble. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. His mouth is on mine, exploring, igniting my blood. I bite my lip, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, pulling my head back as we kiss, savagely. My inner goddess is staring at me in awe.
