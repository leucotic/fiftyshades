Holy hell. That sex appeal!<p> 'You are so beautiful,' he murmurs as he hovers over me. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, insistent, sparking electricity ... below. He softly kisses my face, and a delicious tingling shoots through me. His tongue invades my mouth, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. I gasp and moan , and one of his hands moves into my hair, holding my head in place. My subconscious is staring at me in awe. <p> All of a sudden, he slams me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and my heart is pounding. His hands softly skim across my thighs so that desire seizes me with a vengeance. How can he turn me on with one word?<p>
