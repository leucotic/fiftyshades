Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, exploring, raising uncontrollable urges in me. His eyes glowing with lust, insistent, he softly kisses my cheek. The sensual strains of Miley Cyrus waft through the air. How unexpected. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, holding me firmly in place. <p> 'On your knees.' <p> His rope is coiled on the foot of the bed. I glance nervously at the playroom. His eyes glance over the coil, and I tingle ... everywhere. <p> 'You. Are. So. Beautiful,' he breathes, staring intently into my eyes. Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the desk. It's so hot, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He kisses me, his eyes wild, making me writhe. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing.
