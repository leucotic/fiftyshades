'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he breathes in my ear, igniting a fire deep within. <p> 'Yes.' I swallow. <p> 'I want to hear you moan for me. Good girl.' <p> 'Take me,' I breathe. <p> He lifts my chin, and my breath hitches. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, dominating, tasting. He softly kisses my face, and everything in my body tightens. I gasp and moan , and he curls his fingers into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face. My subconscious does the samba.
