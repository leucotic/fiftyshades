Holy crap. That power!<p> 'I want you so much,' he growls as he hovers over me. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and my heart skips a beat. He softly kisses my cheek, dominating, insistent, tasting. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, and everything in my body tightens. His eyes glowing with lust, he softly kisses my throat. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. His fingers curl into my hair, pulling my head back. My inner goddess glares at me. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the desk. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, making me writhe, making me yearn for him. Exploring, frantic, he kisses me. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me. <p>
