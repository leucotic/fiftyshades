'Do you want me? ,' he growls in my ear, warmth pooling below my waist. My heart starts pounding. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, tasting, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, igniting a fire deep within. He softly kisses my temple, and an electric thrill thrums through me. He curls his fingers around my head, holding me gently in place as we kiss, forcefully. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I glance nervously at the playroom. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Without warning, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the desk. Fuck, I'm panting already, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He gently traces his hands up my body. All the air leaves my body. How can his body do this to me?<p>
