Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the wall. My breathing is too loud, making me writhe, making me writhe. He runs his hands along my neck, and desire seizes me with a vengeance. How can he turn me on with one word?<p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, making my muscles clench deep, deep inside. He softly kisses my temple, tasting, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, he grabs my hair and yanks down, running his fingers through my hair. My inner goddess is thrilled.
