'Do you want me? ,' he breathes, his voice low, and an electric thrill thrums through me as desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'Good. Good girl.' <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I whisper. <p> He lifts my chin, and my heart starts pounding. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, insistent, dominating, his eyes glowing with lust. He softly kisses my throat, insistent, my insides liquefying, making me tremble. Exploring, his eyes glowing with lust, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. I squirm against him, and he curls his fingers into my hair, holding me firmly in place. My subconscious is purring with pleasure.
