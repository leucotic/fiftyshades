'You were very disobedient,' he breathes, his eyes smoky, and everything in my body tightens as everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> 'Good girl,' he whispers, his breathing husky. <p> 'Take me,' I breathe. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my bottom lip, tasting, shallowing my breath. Insistent, his eyes glowing with lust, insistent, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. Holding my head in place, his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, fisting his hands. My subconscious glares at me.
