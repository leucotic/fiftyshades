Suddenly, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the bedpost. I groan, frustrated, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. He kisses me, forceful, making me writhe. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing. <p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and my heart skips a beat. He softly kisses my face, tasting. His tongue invades my mouth, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. One of his hands moves into my hair, lifting his other hand to cradle my face as we kiss. My inner goddess does a slow erotic dance.
