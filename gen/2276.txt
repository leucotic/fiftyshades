Moving suddenly, he slams me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and I'm going to combust. He softly kisses my bottom lip, and desire and anxiety pump through me. All the air leaves my body. <p> Tipping my chin back, he kisses me, insistent, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. He softly kisses my face, dominating, my insides liquefying, making me squirm. His mouth is on mine, exploring, making me squirm. He softly kisses my throat, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. He curls his fingers into my hair, holding me gently in place. My inner goddess does a slow erotic dance.
