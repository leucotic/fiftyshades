'Here? ,' he whispers, his breathing hard, and I tingle ... everywhere as everything in my body tightens. I glance nervously at the bed. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting, making my muscles clench in response. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, shallowing my breath. The sensual strains of Justin Bieber drift through the headphones he put on me. I love his choice. I squirm against him, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding me gently in place as we kiss. <p> That leather strap! We've never used a leather strap before. <i>Holy crap</i>. His fingers brush the strap, and I tingle ... everywhere. <p> Suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, slamming me against the doorway. My heart is pounding, making me yearn for him. His hands trace across my neck so that my body rises and fills with my arousal. How can he turn me on with one word?<p>
