His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. I glance anxiously at the doorway. If only it didn't take a contract and a leather strap to satisfy him. <p> 'Here? ,' he growls in my ear, making me squirm. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He caresses my cheek, gazing at me lovingly, my insides liquefying. <p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and my breathing accelerates. His tongue invades my mouth, insistent, insistent. Tasting, he plants a soft wet kiss on my lips. He softly kisses my bottom lip, his eyes glowing with lust, raising uncontrollable urges in me. Pulling my head back as we kiss, one of his hands moves into my hair, running his fingers through my hair. My subconscious is purring with pleasure. <p> Abruptly, he pushes me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and it's pleasure overload. He trails his fingers along my neck. My heart is pounding. I blush scarlet, humiliated and excited at the same time. <i>Holy cow</i>.
