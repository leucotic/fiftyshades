He leans in, and I'm quaking like a leaf. His mouth is on mine, exploring, his eyes glowing with lust, his eyes glowing with lust. Tasting, dominating, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. He kisses me, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. He curls his fingers around my head, holding me firmly in place as we kiss. My subconscious is screaming at me. <p> 'Face the wall,' he murmurs, making me squirm and raising uncontrollable urges in me. <p> His rope is coiled on the foot of the bed. I tremble nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. Jeez, he's so fucked-up. <p> 'The things I'm going to do to you ...,' he breathes as he hovers over me. Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the shoulders, slamming me against the desk. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, making me yearn for him. His hands softly trail across my body so that I'm drowning in a pool of desire. How can he do this to me?
