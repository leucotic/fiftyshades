His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. I glance nervously at the doorway. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he breathes, his breathing hard, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body as everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Yes. Oh, yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> His lips tense. 'This will be hard, but I won't hurt you.' His fingers graze my face gently, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. <p> Leaning down, he softly kisses my bottom lip, insistent, igniting a fire deep within. He kisses me, and I tingle ... everywhere. He softly kisses my face, insistent, sending shivers down my spine, coursing heat throughout my body. Dominating, his eyes glowing with lust, dominating, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. I moan, and one of his hands moves into my hair, pulling my head back as we kiss. My inner goddess swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> Moving suddenly, he grabs me by the waist, pushing me against the bedpost. I practically convulse, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me writhe. His mouth is on mine, and my craving spirals out of control. It's so eroticâ€”his need for me.
