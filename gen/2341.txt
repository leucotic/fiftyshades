'Do you have anything in mind? ,' he whispers, his voice low, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body as everything in my body tightens. <p> 'Okay,' I breathe . <p> 'Good,' he growls, his breathing harsh. <p> 'Don't make me wait,' I whisper. <p> He runs his nose along my jaw, and I'm quaking like a leaf. His mouth is on mine, tasting, exploring. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, raising uncontrollable urges in me. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, pulling my head back as we kiss. My subconscious glares at me.
