'You were very disobedient,' he growls, his breathing harsh, and everything in my body tightens as my muscles clench deep inside me. <p> 'Okay...' I whisper . <p> 'I want to hear you ,' he breathes, his gaze scorching. <p> 'Surprise me,' I exhale. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, exploring, making me tremble. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, igniting my blood. He kisses me, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. His eyes glowing with lust, he softly kisses my temple. I bite my lip, and one of his hands moves into my hair, holding me gently in place. My subconscious is screaming at me.
