All of a sudden, he grabs me by the shoulders, pushing me against the bedpost. It's pleasure overload, making me writhe, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. His fingertips skim down my thighs so that desire seizes me with a vengeance. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Shit</i>. <p> Tipping my chin back, he softly kisses my bottom lip, exploring, igniting a fire deep within. His skilled tongue invades my mouth, tasting, shallowing my breath, making me squirm. I yelp, and his hand tightens around my hair at my nape, pulling my head back as we kiss, frantically. My subconscious is staring at me in awe.
