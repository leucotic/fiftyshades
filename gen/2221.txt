He straightens. My stomach sinks. I worry, again, that I'm not enough for him. His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. What on earth does he have in store for me? <p> 'You were very disobedient,' he murmurs, his voice husky, and tingling shoots through me as desire unfurls deep in my belly. <p> 'Please,' I breathe . <p> He caresses my cheek, gazing at me tenderly, warmth pooling below my waist. <p> He lifts my chin, and my heart starts pounding. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, tasting. Tasting, his eyes glowing with lust, dominating, he plants a soft kiss on my lips. Exploring, he softly kisses my temple. He kisses me, tasting, igniting my blood, sparking electricity ... below. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, pulling my head back. My subconscious is doing the merengue with some salsa moves. <p> Without warning, he slams me against the bedpost. He holds me against his hips, and it's so eroticâ€”his need for me. He trails his hands softly down my body so that my craving spirals out of control. I flush scarlet. <i>I want him so badly</i>.
