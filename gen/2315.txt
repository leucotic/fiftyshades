'You were very disobedient,' he whispers, his gaze smoky, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously as my muscles clench deep inside me. I glance anxiously at the playroom. <p> Leaning down, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, tasting, igniting a fire deep within. He softly kisses my bottom lip, and dark desire unfolds throughout my body. He curls his fingers into my hair, holding me firmly in place as we kiss, forcefully. My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> His flogger is draped over the edge of the bed. <i>I want him so badly</i>. I can't imagine how he wants to use <i>that</i>. <p> All of a sudden, he yanks me off my feet, slamming me against the bedpost. I'm going to combust, pleasure lancing directly to my groin, making me yearn for him. He plants a soft wet kiss on my lips, forceful, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. It's so hot. <p>
