Shit. That gaze!<p> 'Keep still,' he whispers as he hovers over me. <p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and I'm quaking like a leaf. He softly kisses my face, tasting, exploring. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, and I tingle ... everywhere. He softly kisses my bottom lip, his eyes glowing with lust, making me tremble. I can hear music faintly. How unexpected. Lifting his other hand to cradle my face, one of his hands moves into my hair, fisting his hands. <p> Moving suddenly, he slams me against the doorway. He's pinning me to the doorway using his hips, and I inhale sharply. He softly traces his fingers up my thighs, and my body rises and fills with my arousal. How does he have this power over me?<p>
