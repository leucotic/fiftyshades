His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. I glance anxiously at the doorway. Boy, he's so complicated. <p> 'Here? ,' he breathes. His gaze is gray, smoky, and an electric thrill thrums through me. <p> 'Yes,' I whisper . <p> He touches my face gently, making me tremble. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, dominating, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. Insistent, his skilled tongue invades my mouth. I can hear a song by Justin Bieber drifting through the air. I love his choice. His hand tightens around my hair at my nape, pulling my head back as we kiss. <p> All of a sudden, he yanks me off my feet, pushing me against the desk. Fuck, I'm panting already, making me yearn for him, pleasure lancing directly to my groin. He traces his hands along my thighs so that desire and anxiety pump through me. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Holy hell</i>.
