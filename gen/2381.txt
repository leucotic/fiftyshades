All of a sudden, he shoves me against the wall. He's pinning me to the wall using his hips, and I groan, frustrated. His fingers trace up my thighs gently. Fuck, I'm panting already. Why am I embarrassed by this? <i>Holy shit</i>. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, tasting, igniting a fire deep within. He softly kisses my cheek, exploring, sending delicious shivers down my spine, anticipation and anxiety charging through me. His tongue invades my mouth, insistent, sending shivers through me ... <i>there</i>, feeling spiraling out from deep within my belly. I can hear a song by Justin Bieber drifting through the air. How appropriate. He grabs my hair and yanks down, pulling my head back as we kiss, frantically.
