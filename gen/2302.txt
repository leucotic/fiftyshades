'I am going to teach you a lesson,' he whispers, his gaze scorching, and I tingle ... everywhere as dark desire unfolds throughout my body. <p> 'Yes.' My voice is barely audible. <p> He smirks. 'I want to hear you scream for me.' <p> 'Surprise me,' I whisper. <p> Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting my blood. His mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, shallowing my breath. He softly kisses my cheek, exploring, warmth pooling below my waist, igniting a fire deep within. I squirm against him, and he grabs my hair and yanks down, holding my head in place. My subconscious is purring with pleasure.
