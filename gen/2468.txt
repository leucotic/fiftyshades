'Do you want me? ,' he growls. His breathing is low, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. <p> He runs his nose along my forehead, and my heart skips a beat. He plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes glowing with lust. He kisses me, insistent, sparking electricity ... below, igniting a fire deep within. He curls his fingers into my hair, holding me gently in place as we kiss, savagely. My subconscious glares at me. <p> He smirks at me. Boy, he's so hard to please. His nipple clamps peek out of that velvet drawer. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> Moving suddenly, he shoves me against the wall. He restrains me with his hips, and fuck, I'm panting already. His fingertips trail up my body, and I lose myself to his fervent passion. How can he do this to me?<p>
