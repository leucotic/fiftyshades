'Ready?,' he growls, his breathing harsh, and I tingle ... everywhere as everything in my body tightens. I glance anxiously at the bed. <p> Tipping my chin back, his mouth is on mine, his eyes glowing with lust, igniting my blood. He softly kisses my cheek, and a pulse of warmth pools inside me. His fingers curl into my hair, holding my head in place. My subconscious swoons and passes out somewhere in the back of my head. <p> His leather strap is propped against the stack of books on his desk. I glance anxiously at the playroom. His eyes glance over the strap, and everything south of my waist tightens deliciously. <p> Abruptly, he grabs me by the shoulders, shoving me against the bedpost. I practically convulse, making me writhe, making me writhe. His fingertips trace along my body, and desire courses through my blood. How can his body do this to me?<p>
