Leaning down, he softly kisses my temple, dominating, shallowing my breath. He kisses me, and desire unfurls deep in my belly. His hand tightens around my hair, holding me gently in place as we kiss, savagely. My inner goddess is staring at me in awe. <p> 'Face the wall.' <p> His handcuffs sit on top of the still-rumpled bed. I shiver nervously, excitement blooming deep inside me. I don't know if I can do this for him. <p> 'You are so beautiful,' he growls, staring intently into my eyes. Catching me off guard, he grabs me by the waist, shoving me against the desk. I can see nothing, all I can hear is my rapid breathing, making me yearn for him, making me writhe. His fingertips trace down my belly, and I lose myself to his fervent passion. How does he have this power over me?
